Chartering a project confirms the alignment of the project to the strategy and ongoing work of the organization. High-level information on the project is documented in the project charter. Therefore, if you want to ensure the stakeholders have a common understanding of the deliverables, milestones, and roles and responsibilities of everyone involved in the project, you should share the approved project charter with them.<br/>The document you have been working on with the project initiator is the project charter. You have already secured an approved charter, as described in the scenario, making this choice an incorrect answer.<br/>The scenario implies you have been developing a project charter which then has been approved by the project sponsor. Focus groups are an example of the data gathering technique that can be used as a tool or technique during the Develop Project Charter process to bring stakeholders together to learn about the project in a conversational way. Since the project charter has already been approved, it can be assumed that the focus groups have already been facilitated.<br/>The project charter documents high-level information on the project such as key deliverables, summary milestone schedule, key stakeholder list, and project approval requirements. Therefore, sharing the approved project charter with the stakeholders will provide them with the information described in the scenario.<br/></p></div></div></div></div><br/>

</div></div> </div></div></div><div class='answer'><a class='ans' onclick='showHide(182)'>Ans</a><p style='display:none;' id='ans_182'>3--When being faced with procurement-related questions on the PMP exam, a prospective PMP aspirant has first to determine what side of the procurement the scenario is talking about. While the majority of procurement-related questions on the exam describe the situation from a buyer's point of view, some questions are worded from the seller's perspective. This question is an example of the latter: you are the seller (or a bidder, a vendor). Therefore, some of the answer choices can be eliminated as they refer to processes, inputs, outputs, tools or techniques that are buyer-related.<br/>

As it pertains to the scenario described, it is a good practice for buyers to include their selected evaluation method in the procurement documents, so bidders know how they will be evaluated. Commonly used selection methods include least cost, qualifications only, quality-based/highest technical proposal score, quality and cost-based, sole source, or fixed budget. To position your company as the best fit for the project, it is essential for you to understand the requirements and selection criteria that you need to meet as a seller. Therefore, of the choices provided, looking for the selection method in the procurement documents of the utility company's bid package is the best answer to the question asked.<br/>

Did you notice that the team charter is developed during project planning, but the scenario describes the presence of a team, suggesting the Acquire Resources process, an executing process, has already occurred? This situation illustrates the iterative nature of project management. Ideally, you want the team to create the team charter or at least have the team's input during the charter development. However, it is not always possible. To overcome this, the iterative nature of the project management allows the Plan Resource Management process, or any other process for that matter, to be performed several times during the project life cycle. New documents may be developed, or existing documents may be updated as the project progresses and more information becomes available.<br/>The team management plan is a component of the resource management plan that describes when and how team members will be acquired and how long they will be needed.

Unfortunately, your contract with the vendor does not specify the conditions that establish and protect the customer's IP. The vendor has done nothing wrong by submitting the previous design to your company, and nothing in the question indicates that you have either discussed or by contract bound the vendor to protect the client's IP. Therefore, it was a lapse on the part of your company not to inform or contractually bind the vendor to the same IP restrictions that your company agreed to protect.

When choosing a communication method, it is advisable to include the stakeholders in the final decision, so their communication needs will be met. Communication models describe the process by which information is shared and has three main parts: the sender, the message, and the receiver. Considering both communication models and communication methods will lead to the most effective communication. In the scenario provided, the stakeholders are requesting the project manager to use email as a method in which the information is shared with them. Therefore, of the choices given, the communication method is the best answer.<br/>

<br/>Communication methods describe the way information is transferred and can be grouped into the following categories: interactive communication, push communication, and pull communication. In this scenario, the stakeholders are requesting you to switch the method used to share information with them from conference calls to email, or from an interactive method to a push method. Since the communication method is changing, this choice is correct.<br/>Communication models describe the process of communication in its most basic form: the sender, the message, and the receiver. In this scenario, the process of communication is not changing as it still involves the sender, message, and receiver, but the way the information is transferred is switching from phone to email. Therefore, the communication model is not the correct choice.<br/>The project communications are all project documents and artifacts created during the project lifecycle. Sending the status reports via email instead of having a weekly call does not change all project documents and artifacts created during the project lifecycle, making this choice an incorrect answer.<br/></p></div></div></div></div><br/>

Even though the scenario describes a manufacturing process, the value stream mapping technique is often used on knowledge projects carried out using the agile framework.<br/>

An argument can be made that any of the answer choices represent factors that may have played a role in the decision to move forward with the project. However, a Lean Six Sigma value stream exercise as it relates to a production process is specifically related to process improvements to gain greater efficiencies in capital, labor, and/or materials. Therefore, of the available choices, business process improvements provide the best answer to the question asked.<br/>A change in market demand may drive a company to update their offerings of products or services. For example, an increase in fuel costs may cause consumers to seek more fuel-efficient cars. However, the question describes the implementation of process improvement rather than a response to a change in market demand.<br/>The question suggests that a project was initiated to improve the efficiency of a manufacturing process. Although competitive forces may provide the incentive to improve the efficiency of a production line, there is another answer choice that more directly addresses the situation described by the question.<br/>The question describes a situation where the company has analyzed its production process and recommended improvements, which can be made with the initiation of a project to realize greater efficiency.<br/></p></div></div></div></div><br/>

To adequately complete and close a project, it is necessary for the project manager to obtain 'confirmation' from the customer that the project deliverables have been formally accepted. 'Confirming' the acceptance of the project deliverables during the Close Project or Phase process is different from 'obtaining' formal acceptance of the deliverables during the Validate Scope process. The scenario implies the Validate Scope process has been completed. Therefore, since the project has entered its closure, the project manager is seeking to obtain confirmation that the product scope and deliverables were achieved. By obtaining final acceptance, the project manager is essentially 'confirming' the delivery and formal acceptance of deliverables by the relevant stakeholders. Sometimes, this can be viewed as ticking a checkbox in the checklist of the activities carried out during project closure. It is like asking a question, ""Have the deliverables been accepted earlier in the project as part of the Validate Scope process?"". If the answer is ""Yes"", check the box. This would eventually confirm that the deliverables have already been accepted and that the relevant stakeholders are aware of this fact and agree that the project can now be closed. This is a subtle distinction, and many PMP aspirants struggle with this concept.<br/>

This question is a good example of what you will see on your real exam – two answer choices arguably being correct answers. The main lesson to take from this question is to be ready during the real exam to face ambiguous questions with answer choices extremely close to one another and always select the answer choice you think is the best of those provided. It will not always be the ideal answer or the answer you would like to see as the correct one, but it should be better than the others. Unfortunately, on the real exam, you will never know the actual correct answer to a particular question. You will only see your final result and will be unable to contact the PMI and argue with them on the correctness of their answers. Therefore, the best advice we can provide you while you are preparing for and taking your exam is to make reasonable assumptions based on all available information in the scenario and, of the choices given, select the ‘best’ answer to the question asked or the answer you believe should be the correct one.<br/>Inspection of deliverables takes place in the Control Quality process. This process results in verified deliverables that are then used as an input into the Validate Scope process. The question states the project manager is seeking to close out the project implying the Close Project or Phase process is being carried out, which, in turn, means that inspecting the quality of the redesign deliverables would have already taken place.<br/>While this answer choice sounds like a plausible option, the formal acceptance of project deliverables should be obtained from the customer, not from the stakeholders. Additionally, the process of 'obtaining' the formal acceptance happens prior to project closure, as part of the Validate Scope process. The Close Project or Phase process described in the scenario is concerned with 'confirming' the delivery and formal acceptance not with 'obtaining' formal acceptance. Finally, the scenario states that the project has already received formal acceptance of the deliverables, thus eliminating the need to obtained formal acceptance of project deliverables again.<br/>Obtaining feedback for design improvements would have occurred prior to performing closing processes, and therefore this answer choice is not the correct answer.<br/></p></div></div></div></div><br/>

However, strong and talented people will be able to find a way to accomplish almost any task even when processes are weak.<br/>The project kick-off meeting is held at the beginning of the project, which, as the scenario implies, has already past. Apart from the project kick-off meeting, there are many other agile events that provide the opportunity for face-to-face communication, such as daily standups, as well as sprint planning, review, and retrospective meetings.<br/>Letting the team members introduce the project to the new developer empowers the team members. It provides the team with a leadership opportunity as well as a strong sense of ownership for the project.<br/>On agile projects, tasks are not assigned to team members by the scrum master or anyone else. Tasks are pulled from the backlog by the team members based on agreed-upon rules.<br/></p></div></div></div></div><br/>

The development approach describes the development approach taken to produce the product, the service, or the result of the project. Examples of development approaches include predictive, iterative, agile, or hybrid. In the scenario described, some of the deliverables are developed using Scrum (which is an example of agile) while others produced using traditional methods. This implies the project, as a whole, is executed using a hybrid project management approach. Therefore, the project management plan should reflect this information as the development approach selected for the project. For example, during the development of the project management plan, it is possible that the project team determined that there were going to be many changes to some of the project deliverables due to their nature (e.g., a software application) and, therefore, a Scrum framework would be best do develop those deliverables. Going with this example, requirements for other deliverables, on the other hand, were determined upfront favoring the traditional project management approach. Therefore, of the choices provided, showing the development approach within the project management plan to the project sponsor would be the best course of action for the project manager to take to address the sponsor's request.<br/>The project life cycle description provides the series of phases that the project passes through from its initiation to its closure. The project life cycle description does not contain information about the development approach used to produce the project deliverables.<br/>Although the project team members are likely to know about the approach they are using to develop the product, sending the sponsor to the team will possibly interrupt the team's work. It's the project manager’s responsibility to communicate with the sponsor and other stakeholders and let the team do their work with as few interruptions as possible.<br/>The project charter is the document that authorizes the existence of a project, names the project manager and provides them with the authority to apply organizational resources to project activities.

However, when conflict becomes destructive, it may be appropriate and necessary for the scrum master to intervene. The appropriate action for the scrum master to take in this circumstance would be to take a break and address individuals in private.

In the scenario provided, the goal is clear - developing a vaccine against the deadly virus and preventing it from spreading across the globe. However, the vaccine itself (the solution to the problem) is obviously unclear since the virus is new, and no vaccine exists, yet. Even those who are not familiar with the specifics of the pharmaceutical industry understand that a lot of experimentation will be required to develop the vaccine. Under these circumstances, most of the project aspects, including the vaccine approval process, can be managed using the predictive project management approach. However, the development phase of the vaccine will be better off with agile methods, allowing short development cycles, testing, early feedback, and adaptation. The combination of the predictive and agile project management approaches will result in a hybrid project.<br/> A well-defined, formal, and structured vaccine approval process is best managed using the traditional project management approach. The vaccine development phase, on the other hand, will benefit from experimentation that is best achieved with agile methods. The combination of these approaches will result in a hybrid project, making this choice the best answer to the question asked.<br/>The agile project management approach will best work for projects that are characterized by uncertainty. In the scenario provided, only the vaccine development portion of the project falls under this category.

So what will be your primary concern with regards to the audit? As mentioned above, quality audits do not focus on the product or the project's schedule or cost performance. Therefore, of the choices available, ensuring that work complies with the company policies, processes, and procedures should be your primary concern.<br/>Not every piece of information provided is actually relevant to the question. In this case, the project being behind schedule (as indicated by the SPI number) is an irrelevant issue, since quality audits are not concerned with the schedule or cost performance of a project but rather how the work being performed lines up with the policies, processes, and procedures of the organization.<br/>Quality audits in Manage Quality do not focus on the product, but rather on the processes and their conformance to the quality management plan.<br/>This sounds more like the activities that take place in the Control Quality process, which focus on determining if the project outputs are complete, correct, and meet customer expectations.<br/></p></div></div></div></div><br/>

</div></div> </div></div></div><div class='answer'><a class='ans' onclick='showHide(197)'>Ans</a><p style='display:none;' id='ans_197'>2--The situation described in the question suggests that there is no more time to discuss the technical approach as the first iteration was already supposed to begin. In addition, there is no point in proceeding with the meeting since the participants do not seem to agree on anything. The decision on the technical approach has to be made by the end of the meeting. Good leaders know when to step in without damaging the self-organization of agile teams. While not ideal, the only reasonable choice for the scrum master under the circumstances described in the scenario is to select an approach and make a decision.<br/>

In the reference provided, the author states, ""Good leaders have earned the credibility to make these decisions. The technical staff respect the leader’s judgment (based on previous actions taken), participate in the analysis and debate process, and willingly accept the decision to move on. The leader has absorbed the ambiguity of the situation, whereas leaving the decision to consensus would have bogged the project down in an interminable debate. Good leaders know when to step in and take charge and when to encourage the team to take charge. They also know when to dig into why team decision making isn’t working as it should.""<br/>In the situation described in the question, further discussion may not be productive as participants cannot agree. In fast-moving product development efforts, where key decisions must be made quickly, decision making based on consensus often fails. Discussion and debate simply prolong the decision-making process which should be time-boxed in Agile.<br/>Based on the information described in the question, there is no point to continue the debate. This technical meeting is supposed to be the last meeting in the series. It was time to make a decision. While not ideal, this answer is the best option among the choices given.<br/>According to the scenario, this meeting was supposed to be the last in the series by the end of which a decision had to be made. Agile events are time-boxed. Another meeting would further delay a decision. In addition, inviting external experts may harm the team’s confidence in their ability to resolve technical issues internally.<br/></p></div></div></div></div><br/>

</div></div> </div></div></div><div class='answer'><a class='ans' onclick='showHide(198)'>Ans</a><p style='display:none;' id='ans_198'>4--The question describes a situation where a project team member is demonstrating unacceptable behavior by arriving to work more than 30 minutes late on more than one occasion. The team charter establishes clear expectations regarding acceptable behavior by project team members. Ground rules, defined in the team charter set the expected behavior for project team members, as well as other stakeholders, with regard to stakeholder engagement. The team charter can be reviewed and updated periodically to ensure a continued understanding of the team and ground rules and to orient and integrate new team members. Had the team charter been reviewed periodically, the newest project team member would have had a clear understanding of acceptable and unacceptable behavior. While establishing standards of behavior does not necessarily mean that the project team member would have adhered to those standards, of the available choices, only reviewing the team charter directly addresses behavioral expectations. Therefore, reviewing the team charter is the best answer to the question asked.<br/>

Note that a valid argument can be made to support cultural awareness training as a correct answer in this scenario. Although not described by the question, it is possible that the newest team member has a cultural perspective that does not value punctuality. It is also possible that cultural awareness training may have been beneficial, assuming that cultural differences did exist. There are questions on the actual PMP exam which will have more than one correct answer, and the PMP aspirant must choose the 'best' answer even if the question does not specifically ask for the 'best' response. In this case, the team charter directly addresses acceptable and unacceptable behavior by the project team members which should include punctuality. While cultural awareness training may or may not have been beneficial in this case, it does not directly establish standards of behavior. Even if the cultural differences did exist, reviewing the team charter should address the issue by setting the standards of behavior regardless of cultural values. Additionally, the fact that the issue occurred with the ""newest team member"" is a hint that this individual may not have been exposed to the team charter previously if it was only covered at the start of the project and before this person joined the team.<br/>Although not described by the question, it is possible that the newest team member has a cultural perspective that does not value punctuality. It is also possible that cultural awareness training may have been beneficial, assuming that cultural differences did exist. However, there is another answer choice which more accurately addresses issues regarding the behavior of project team members, which is a better answer to the question asked.<br/>The scenario does not indicate whether or not there was a conflict among the project team members. The question describes undesirable behavior demonstrated by the team member. While it is not clear whether or not conflict management training would have been helpful in this situation, there is another answer choice which better addresses behavioral issues on the part of the project team members.<br/>The question states that you, as the project manager, have not had any similar issues with the project team previously. Since this appears to be the first instance of this problem on the project, it could not have been captured previously in the issue log. Although the issue should now be recorded in the issue log, this action will be done after the fact and, therefore, would not have prevented the issue from occurring in the first place.<br/></p></div></div></div></div><br/>

Prototypes are typically small-scale products, 2D & 3D computer models, mock-ups, storyboards, or simulations that tend to be rudimentary until enough experimentation, feedback, and revision have been obtained to move to a build phase. In this scenario, prototypes would have been beneficial to use since they would allow stakeholders to experiment with a model of the final product rather than being limited to discussing abstract representations of their requirements. Note, the scenario describes a project lead by a hybrid project management approach where the requirements are collected using the Collect Requirements process, which is typical of waterfall projects, while the software being developed in iterations, implying an agile framework is used to build the product.<br/>

Tacit knowledge can be described as people's ideas and experiences. Creating user stories and building the product increment, where developers and customers talk among themselves and share ideas, is one such example. The more the team members share information, knowledge, and customer interaction, the lower the knowledge gap between the team members. This will logically minimize knowledge and experience gaps if someone leaves the project. Additionally, colocation enables better communication, improves team dynamics, and reduces the cost of learning.<br/>According to the Agile Manifesto, agile practitioners value working software over comprehensive documentation.

On the surface, each of the answer choices might seem appropriate. However, since both the client and the vendor lead their projects using the agile project management approach, only one choice is suitable since it reflects one of the twelve guiding agile principles. Guiding principle seven states: ""Working software is the primary measure of progress."" Therefore, the progress of the vendor should be assessed based on the released versions of the vendor's work, such as product increments.<br/>Unlike traditionally managed projects, agile does not typically use weekly progress reports to determine the status of the project's progress.<br/>Daily standup meetings are intended for the members of the development team to report on work completed yesterday, plan the work for today, and raise any impediments to progress. Additionally, the vendor's daily standup meetings are for the vendor's team, not for the client representatives.<br/>A procurement audit is one of the tools and techniques that can be used as part of the Control Procurements process to review contracts and contracting processes for completeness, accuracy, and effectiveness. First, this tool is typically used on traditional, rather than agile projects.

With this approach, the project will typically follow all of the scrum ceremonies and incorporate a Kanban board with work in progress (WIP) limits to track the features or user stories through the stages of development from the backlog to completion. In this case, since the performing organization lacks experience with agile methodologies, the project team and other stakeholders are not likely to have the depth of knowledge needed to implement Scrumban successfully. Thus, it will be important for the newly hired scrum master to identify and provide the necessary training for the project team and any other relevant stakeholders. Conducting an agile workshop with the project team will provide the team with a basic understanding of the agile mindset and principles. Also, since the product owner is responsible for maximizing the value of the product, it will be important to train the product owner on how to prioritize the project backlog according to business value. Additionally, with the inclusion of Kanban, the development team will need to understand how the work will flow through the various stages of development along with honoring the WIP limits as represented on the Kanban board.

This situation can happen when the performing organization is not mature enough with its project management approach. For example, the organization uses tools and techniques that are incompatible with the project processes, incorrectly tailors processes to a project, or implements any other combination of tools or techniques that is inconsistent with the selected development approach or project life cycle. The critical path method is one of the tools and techniques that can be used as part of the Control Schedule process implied by the scenario. However, this method is mainly applicable to projects that are managed using predictive approaches. With this technique, the project's progress is compared along the critical path to determine the schedule status. A variance between the actual performance and the baseline will have a direct impact on the project end date. When agile approaches are used, e.g., when the product is developed using iterations, as described in the scenario, the Control Schedule process may include backlog reprioritization, iteration retrospectives, velocity calculation, etc. Evaluating the variance between the schedule baseline and the critical path would not be useful for agile practices and, therefore, should be avoided.<br/>Reprioritizing the backlog is an agile practice aimed to order the tasks (user stories, remaining work items) according to their priority. Since the scenario describes a project in which the work is carried out using iterations, avoiding the backlog prioritization would be unwise.<br/> A retrospective is a meeting used by agile teams to reflect on the process used to carry out project work and improve. When iterations are used to develop the product, as stated in the scenario, conducting iteration retrospectives is imperative for the project's success and, therefore, should not be avoided.<br/>Velocity is the rate at which the deliverables are produced, validated, and accepted in the given time per iteration. Since the project team employes iterations to produce the deliverables, determining the velocity would help in controlling the project schedule and, therefore, is not the practice to avoid.<br/></p></div></div></div></div><br/>

For example, a project as a whole can be managed using the traditional (predictive, waterfall) project management approach, while the project deliverables, e.g., a software application, is developed using one of the agile frameworks, such as Scrum, XP, Kanban, ane combination of those, etc. The scenario indicates that the organization has decided to use Scrum as the development approach for all of the organization's upcoming projects. The project team, however, does not have any experience with Scrum. One of the responsibilities of a project manager, as a servant leader, is to ensure that the project team members possess the necessary skills to perform their work effectively. Thus, in this case, the project manager should arrange for Scrum training. Training costs can be included in the project budget or applied at the organizational level. When the skills to be acquired from the training will be unique to a particular project, then the training costs should be included in the project budget. In the scenario, the Scrum skills acquired from the training will likely benefit all future projects for which the project team will be assigned. Therefore, requesting the organization to absorb the training costs makes the most sense and is, therefore, the best answer to the question asked.<br/>Holding a Scrum workshop is a good idea. However, the cost should not be included in the project budget. Since the organization will be using the Scrum framework for all projects going forward, the training will enhance the project team members' skills that will apply to the current project as well as future projects. Since the training will benefit many projects, the cost should be absorbed at the organizational level rather than the project level.<br/>Agile teams are self-organizing. However, the project team will need to have at least a basic understanding of agile best practices, including the cadence of how work is planned and executed in Scrum. Not providing some form of Scrum training hoping the team will learn as they do the job would unlikely lead to a successful project outcome.<br/>The project manager has an obligation to ensure that the project team members have the necessary training to complete their work. Since the training will benefit future projects as well as the current project, the organization should absorb the training costs.<br/></p></div></div></div></div><br/>

More importantly, the other choices are either not a tool or technique or would not result in improved team cohesion or improved productivity.<br/>Colocation would bring the project team together in one physical location and enhance the team members' ability to perform more productively as a team.<br/>The scenario described in the question implies the project team members are currently organized as a virtual team and using video conferencing to interact.

As a component of a schedule management plan, the level of accuracy specifies the acceptable range used in determining realistic duration estimates. The range accounts for risk contingencies. These contingencies may be some threats of delay or opportunities to gain efficiencies and accelerate the schedule. A project in the initiation phase (which is the case in this scenario) might have a rough order of magnitude estimate in the -25% to +75% range. If you would estimate 8 weeks is most likely, a rough range of 4 to 12 weeks is reasonable. But that range is not among your answer choices.

Since there is a high degree of uncertainty in the cost of materials to be procured for the project, developing an accurate cost baseline seems unrealistic. In this situation, instead of trying to produce detailed cost calculations, the project manager is better off applying lightweight estimation methods, which are typically used on agile projects. This will allow generating a fast, high-level forecast of project costs, which can then be easily adjusted as changes in the costs of materials arise. Applying agile lightweight estimating techniques to the project that is mainly managed using predictive methods (as evident from the scenario that describes scope and schedule baselines) implies the project, as a whole, will be managed using a hybrid project management approach.<br/>With a high degree of uncertainty in the cost of materials, providing accurate estimates would be unlikely possible. Under these circumstances, lightweight agile estimation methods can be used. Then, as the project progresses, the costs can be adjusted for short-term planning in a just-in-time fashion.<br/>Developing the product in iterations would make sense if the requirements are unclear or if there is a need for incremental delivery of value. The scenario, however, states that the scope baseline has been approved, implying the requirements are mainly stable. No information is provided as to whether the value should be delivered frequently.<br/>According to the scenario, the scope baseline has been approved. WBS is one of the components of the scope baseline. Replacing the WBS with a backlog for no reason is unlikely to help with the problem at hand, which is the uncertainty in the cost of materials rather than an undefined scope.<br/></p></div></div></div></div><br/>

Each cycle includes the process of determining requirements, analysis, design, development, and testing. The main difference is that in iteration-based agile, each iteration is of the same length (timebox), and each timebox results in a completed feature(s). In flow-based agile, the time it takes to complete a feature is different for each feature. The team pulls features from the backlog based on the team's capacity to start work. The team defines its workflow with columns on a task board (e.g., a Kanban board) and manages the work in progress for each column. According to the scenario, the customer wants the features delivered as the features are completed even if the time between the deliverables will vary from one feature to another. Therefore, of the choices available, flow-based agile is the best fit for the customer needs and, therefore, the best answer to the question asked.<br/>In iteration-based agile, the team works, as the name implies, in iterations to deliver completed features. In the scenario, however, the customer prefers to have the features delivered as they are completed, regardless of the time that passes between the deliverables. Therefore, imposing timeboxes would prevent some of the features from being delivered right after they are completed, since the team will have to wait for the end of the iteration. On the other hand, big features will need to be sliced and delivered over the course several iterations, thus adding complexity to the process.<br/>In flow-based agile, the team pulls features from the backlog based on the team's capacity to start work rather than on an iteration-based schedule. Since it's more important for the customer to have the features delivered as they are ready rather than based on the timeboxed schedule, flow-based agile would be the best approach.<br/>While some hybrid combinations may exist, ""predictive-based agile"" is a made-up term.<br/></p></div></div></div></div><br/>

</div></div> </div></div></div><div class='answer'><a class='ans' onclick='showHide(217)'>Ans</a><p style='display:none;' id='ans_217'>1--The scenario describes a construction project. Typically, construction projects seem as traditionally managed with well-defined requirements, detailed upfront planning, ""by-the-book"" execution, monitoring and controlling, and closing. Delivering value incrementally and/or receiving an early return on investment often appears either impossible or hard to achieve. However, the application of hybrid project management methods may help in meeting these goals. For example, in the scenario provided that describes the construction of 100 single-family houses, constructing the houses sequentially, one-by-one may provide the performing organization with the opportunity to sell the houses as they are completed thus bringing in an early value (or revenue, or return on investment) as requested by the sponsor. This hybrid approach combines the elements of predictive methods where the deliverables are first produced, then tested, validated, and finally accepted at the end of the project and agile practices, in which deliverables are produced as the project progresses allowing an early return on investment.<br/>

Note, while this is a simplistic example that does not account for the various market- and industry-specific considerations, of the choices provided, constructing the houses sequentially, one-by-one, represents the best answer to the question asked.<br/>When a house is completed, it can be sold, thus allowing the performing organization to take advantage of the revenue from the sale. The earliest return on investment can be achieved when the first house is completed and sold. Hence, by constructing the houses sequentially, one-by-one, the sponsor's request can be met.<br/>If all the houses are constructed simultaneously, it is reasonable to assume that they will be completed at the same time, likely toward the end of the project. Therefore, the return on investment would not be possible earlier than the project is formally completed and closed, which would not satisfy the sponsor's request.<br/>Crashing the schedule would likely satisfy the sponsor's request to get an early value from the project. However, according to the scenario, the project has a fixed budget, implying no additional resources can be acquired without impacting the budget. Therefore, crashing the schedule using additional resources is not a plausible option.<br/></p></div></div></div></div><br/>

When using a predictive model, tasks are typically assigned to specific individuals and then recorded in the project schedule. When an agile framework is employed, project tasks (user stories in this case) are assigned at the team level rather than the individual level, and the project team then collaborates to determine how the tasks will be completed and by whom. A team charter that was developed for a predictive phase is not likely to contain agreements for how the work will be assigned. Therefore, the project manager should revisit the team's social contract (team charter) before the start of an agile phase and have the team align on how they will collaborate to complete the work, rather than making the assignments for the team.<br/>When using a Kanban board, the team will need to collaborate to complete the required work. How the team will collaborate to determine work assignments should be reflected in the team's social contract (team charter).<br/>In some cases, projects may benefit by combining project management frameworks. For example, a project with a development phase that is characterized by unclear requirements and high rates of change might benefit from an agile approach within an otherwise predictive model. When a traditional waterfall model is combined with agile methodologies, the project becomes a hybrid.<br/>eXtreme Programming, similar to Scrumban, is one of the agile frameworks. When any of the agile frameworks are used, tasks are typically pulled by the team members rather than assigned by a manager. The essence of the question reflects an issue with 'how' the work is managed rather than a project management approach used.<br/></p></div></div></div></div><br/>

Communication technology is the best answer choice because it can provide virtual team members with shared repositories for information sharing and more interactive forms of communication, such as video and audio conferencing, to enhance understanding and coordination. The other answer choices are also tools used to develop project teams, but they focus on issues that are not as relevant to the problem here, such as enhancing interpersonal relations among team members, resolving conflict, or evaluating team performance.

These factors are considered sources of the issue and areas of improvement for the solution. From a coaching perspective, in cases where staff members are not performing as expected, agile coaches first assume that this is due to a lack of capability rather than motivation. In the scenario, the agile coach helped hire a new team member and believes the new team member is a valuable asset to the team and project. Therefore, assuming the lack of motivation is the cause of the problem would be premature. Before jumping to conclusions, experienced agile coaches should first assume the team member lacks information, tools, etc., and help find a solution to deliver results. As stated in the reference, ""Agile leaders understand that there will be motivational problems with only a small percentage of employees (they have tried to get the right people, after all). They approach performance as a capability issue and first assume that staff members who aren't performing don't have the information, tools, or experience for the task at hand.""<br/>While this choice could be a plausible answer, the scenario states the agile coach helped hire the new team member. Therefore, unless the new team member only pretended to be a motivated individual, it could be reasonably assumed that the aspect of motivation was tested and checked off during the hiring process.<br/>The product backlog is an ordered list of user stories (features, requirements, etc.) that an agile team maintains for the product. If the product backlog was insufficiently refined, it is likely that all, or at least more than one team member, would have difficulties doing their work.<br/>The work in progress (WIP) limits specify how many work items could be at the same time at any given state on the task board. When the WIP limits are too tight, it is possible that the new team member was idle due to an insufficient number of items to work on. However, with wide WIP limits, there are enough (even too many) items to keep each team member busy, unlikely resulting in poor performance.<br/></p></div></div></div></div><br/>

This is evident from the fact that the phases have well-defined requirements, a clear cost structure, and a fixed schedule. The prototype phase has a high degree of variability. Understanding this fact, the project manager decides that such a phase would benefit from a different project management approach. In other words, the project manager applies hybrid methods to the project as a whole. Projects (or phases) with a high degree of variability benefit from team structures that maximize focus and collaboration, such as self-organizing teams with generalizing specialists. Collaboration is intended to boost productivity and facilitate innovative problem-solving. Collaborative teams may facilitate improved communication, better knowledge sharing, and a higher degree of flexibility of work assignments. An additional advantage of such teams is that it typically takes less time to make decisions since the teams are self-organizing and empowered to make decisions related to their work. Since the question is asking, ""What is the project manager trying to avoid?"", increased time for decision making represents the best answer to the question asked.<br/>Improved communication is one of the benefits of having a self-organizing team. In the scenario, the project manager is putting together a self-organizing team comprised of generalizing specialists. Therefore, the project manager is not trying to avoid improved communication.<br/>In traditional projects, decisions are made base on the processes and procedures specified in the project management plan. The decision-making process may take time and even become a bottleneck. Projects (or phases) with high variability require decisions to be made quickly to adapt to frequent changes. Self-organizing empowered teams make such decisions faster, thus decreasing, not increasing the time for decision making. Therefore, the project manager is trying to avoid the increased time for decision making.<br/>Better knowledge sharing is one of the merits of a self-organizing team. Avoiding this characteristic for the prototype phase is unlikely what the project manager was trying to avoid in the scenario described.<br/></p></div></div></div></div><br/>

By using project-specific indicators, the project management team can assess and identify specific training, coaching, mentoring, assistance, or changes required to improve performance. Regular formal and informal assessments allow the project management team to address issues and develop strategies to increase the likelihood of successfully meeting project goals<br/>This question aptly describes team performance assessments, which are used throughout the project life cycle to evaluate team performance. Assessment results provide project managers with information that may help identify specific training, coaching, mentoring, assistance, or changes needed to improve the team's overall performance and effectiveness.<br/>Work performance reports are the physical or electronic representation of work performance information compiled from various controlling processes. This includes information such as status reports of deliverables, information notes, and electronic dashboards.

</div></div> </div></div></div><div class='answer'><a class='ans' onclick='showHide(225)'>Ans</a><p style='display:none;' id='ans_225'>2--The situation described in the question is told through the eyes of the product owner. It was the product owner’s perception that the team members were getting burned out. But were they really? To confirm or reject this assumption, the matter should be brought up with the team for a discussion. Agile teams are self-organizing, self-managing, and empowered to make decisions concerning their work. It is up to the team to determine whether it is burnout or any other factor that slows down the team's performance, and whatever the reason is, decide on potential solutions. Agile leaders should refrain from making decisions for the team. In the reference provided the author states, ""Often, these conclusions are erroneous, and if left to themselves, managers may jump into action to 'fix the problem'."" The author further suggests that agile leaders ""can reinforce sustainable pace, the idea that each person needs to work at a pace sustainable for them and their current life situation. The coach can create a retrospective agenda that allows the burnout topic to emerge, get talked about, and resolved. A manager need not plan a fun day to help relieve perceived burnout."" Therefore, while the slow team's progress described in the scenario can be objectively measured, the reason for this downtick in performance should not be speculated by a third party but rather brought up with the team for a discussion to find the root cause and decide on the best course of action.<br/>The product owner is responsible for guiding the direction of the product and delivering the highest value to the customer. While these goals cannot be achieved without a healthy and high-performing agile team, the performance and well-being of the team is not the product owner's responsibility. In this scenario, the team lead is the one who should take care of such problems. Therefore, bouncing the problem back to the individual who brought it up would not be the best course of action for the team lead.<br/>Agile teams are self-organizing. The agile team lead should raise these concerns with the team, so the team can confirm that there is indeed an issue. In most cases, agile leaders should refrain from resolving issues for the team. The team lead, however, can facilitate team discussions as needed.<br/>Taking a team on a fun day sounds like an idea that could work almost for any team at any time. However, in the current situation, it may be a premature fix for what could be a non-existent issue. If there were an issue, the team should be involved in figuring out how to resolve it.<br/></p></div></div></div></div><br/>

</div></div> </div></div></div><div class='answer'><a class='ans' onclick='showHide(226)'>Ans</a><p style='display:none;' id='ans_226'>2--It is important to remember that risks may include threats as well as opportunities. Therefore, to make sure an organization takes advantage of opportunities, the project should be planned in a way that the opportunities are maximized when they arise. Implement Risk Responses, which is the process the project manager is about to carry out in the scenario described, ensures that agreed-upon risk responses are executed as planned in order to address overall project risk exposure, minimize individual project threats, and maximize individual project opportunities. The question states that the opportunity described by the question was identified and analyzed during project planning, which suggests it was recorded in the risk register. The risk register will contain the agreed-upon risk response plan (both threats and opportunities) for each individual risk along with the risk owner. The response plan might include submitting a change request to take advantage of the opportunity as an element. Therefore, of the available choices, a review of the risk register and the implementation of the risk response plan is what should be done next.<br/>

One may argue that submitting a change request to expand the project scope is a better answer choice. Well, indeed, this could be a plausible correct answer since the scope baseline will have to be updated to reflect the scope change. This question is a good example of what you will see on your real exam – two answer choices which could be equally correct. Both submitting a change request and reviewing the risk register and implementing the risk response plan are plausible next steps a project manager could take in this situation. We have selected reviewing the risk register just because we could not mark two choices being correct answers. The main lesson to take from this question is to be ready during the real exam to face ambiguous questions with answer choices extremely close to one another and always select the answer choice you think is the best of those provided. It will not always be the ideal answer or the answer you would like to see as the correct one, but it should be better than the others. Unfortunately, on the real exam, you will never know what the actual correct answer to a particular question was. You will only see your final result and will be unable to contact the PMI to argue with them on the correctness of their answers. Therefore, the best advice we can provide you while you are preparing for and taking your exam is to make reasonable assumptions based on all available information in the scenario and, of the choices given, select the ‘best’ answer to the question asked or the answer you believe should be the correct one.<br/>

<br/>This action is premature as several steps need to be taken before the project team can begin work on the mobile application. Specifically, the risk register must be reviewed, risk owner notified, implementation of the risk response, and submission and approval of a change request. Therefore, asking the project team to begin work on the mobile application is not what should be done next in this scenario.<br/>The question states that the opportunity described by the question was identified and addressed during project planning, which suggests it was recorded in the risk register. The risk register will contain the agreed-upon risk response plan (both threats and opportunities) for each individual risk along with the risk owner. Therefore, of the available options, a review of the risk register and implementation of the risk response plan is what should be done next.<br/>The fact that the opportunity has been identified by the project sponsor does not imply that discussing the opportunity with the project sponsor should be done next. It is not known from the question what involvement will be required by the project sponsor. Relevant information such as the roles and responsibilities for risk responses is contained in the risk register. Therefore, the risk register should be reviewed first followed by the implementation of the agreed-upon risk response plan (which may or may not include discussions with the project sponsor). While it is reasonable to assume that the project sponsor will have to be notified about this important opportunity at some point, the question is asking to select the ‘next’ step to be taken in this situation. Discussing the opportunity with the project sponsor is not what should be done next.<br/></p></div></div></div></div><br/>

But in this scenario, the trend of people asking to leave the project over the course of the project life cycle seems to be more than just the work or the understanding of the project objectives.

Emotional intelligence (EI) is a range of competencies around the ability to identify, assess, and manage the personal emotions of oneself and other people, as well as the collective emotions of groups of people. As such, the project manager may not be observing or recognizing the emotions of others and/or herself. The breakdown of relationships and the collapse of a healthy environment may lead to higher staff turnover. Investing more in EI may translate to less project team turnover.<br/>There is not enough information in the question to determine if there is too much (or too little) work assigned to the team members.<br/>The question states that the work is getting done and the project is on track, implying the project team is sufficiently trained to be able to complete the project activities.<br/>Emotional intelligence would help the project manager understand relationships, self-awareness, and other emotional components beyond just getting the project team to get work done.<br/></p></div></div></div></div><br/>

The development team should be headed by a technical lead, while the product team should be lead by a product manager, which in Scrum is called a product owner. As stated by the author in the reference, ""One of the key reasons internal IT projects fail or underperform is misunderstanding the nature of these two roles. On many IT projects, the role of product manager, by default, tends to fall to someone in IT, which usually leads to disaster. The product manager must come from outside the IT department. The rule for IT projects should be: No customer-supplied product manager, no project."" This rule applies not only to internal IT projects but to the most agile projects in general.<br/>

According to scrum best practices, for the project to be managed most effectively, several roles, such as the scrum master and the product owner, require to be assigned to dedicated individuals. Development team members are typically generalizing specialists and can assume different roles during the course of the project, such as developers, testers, and so on.<br/>Assuming the project is managed by scrum best practices, the scrum master and the product owner roles should not be merged. Each role should be performed by a dedicated individual.<br/>The primary responsibility of any agile team is to develop the product, i.e., create value for the customer. Charging the development team members with other responsibilities not directly related to their work would detract from the team's ability to create value, thus negatively impacting the project.<br/>According to scrum best practices, the product owner role should be assigned to a dedicated individual. This separation should help reduce potential misunderstandings between the development team and senior management.<br/></p></div></div></div></div><br/>

Organizational theory provides information about how people, teams, and organizational units behave - in this case, the project team.

Psychologist Abraham Maslow grouped motivational factors into a hierarchy, with physiological needs such as air, food, water, and sleep at the lowest and most fundamental level. He argued that these essential needs must be met before people can be motivated by higher-order factors, such as financial security, recognition, and social acceptance. In order to best motivate the project team, it is important to ensure that basic needs are indeed met, such as ensuring a standard work schedule and providing reasonable working conditions.<br/>

</div></div> </div></div></div><div class='answer'><a class='ans' onclick='showHide(234)'>Ans</a><p style='display:none;' id='ans_234'>4--The scenario describes a procurement process where the buyer is contracting a vendor and requesting them to deliver a product using agile best practices. Agile procurement is based on one of the Agile Manifesto values, ""customer collaboration over contract negotiation"". Unlike traditional projects, where the big emphasis is given on developing comprehensive contracts, agile projects value a collaborative approach to contracting. In this approach, both sides, the buyer and the seller, share risk and reward. One example is the incremental delivery with payment on incremental acceptance contract. This contract type stipulates that the vendor provides a working product increment that passed integration and testing on the vendor side, and is then tested by the buyer. Once the increment is tested and accepted by the buyer, the payment is issued.<br/>

<br/>Not-to-exceed with fixed-fee contract type is typically used on projects with stable requirements. Based on the scenario described, the product is going to be delivered using agile methods. Agile best practices go hand in hand with changing requirements. Therefore, not-to-exceed with a fixed-fee contract would not be the best to be used in this situation.<br/>The second part of this option, ""incremental delivery"", makes this choice sound like a plausible answer. However, the scenario states that the vendor has been requested to deliver a product using agile best practices. This implies the buyer anticipates many changes throughout the project life cycle, making fixed scope type of contract unreasonable.<br/>This answer choice can be eliminated because agile projects, like the one described in the scenario, are undertaken in the environment of changing requirements. Therefore the scope is unlikely to be fixed.<br/></p></div></div></div></div><br/>

This is evident from the way the question is worded by calling out the Control Scope and Validate Scope processes, which are typical for the predictive projects, while iterations are typical for agile projects. When a product is developed iteratively, each iteration results in a working product increment or a functional product subset. To enable continuous customer and stakeholder involvement and feedback on the deliverables, as requested by the scenario, carrying our the Control Scope and Validate Scope processes after each iteration makes the most sense. This would allow the project team to demonstrate the deliverables at the end of each iteration and get feedback as to whether the deliverables meet the customer and stakeholder expectations, are there any improvements to be done, flaws to be fixed, or scope creep to be eliminated. Therefore, performing the Control Scope and Validate Scope processes after each iteration is the best answer to the question asked.<br/> According to the scenario, the product will be developed iteratively, implying the team will create product increments with each consecutive iteration. Carrying out the Control Scope and Validate Scope processes with each iteration would allow frequent feedback on the deliverables, as indicated by the customer and stakeholders at the kick-off meeting.<br/>Performing the Control Scope and Validate Scope processes at the end of the project would not allow the continuous customer and stakeholder engagement and their feedback on the deliverables. Since the development of the product will be done iteratively, more frequent interactions with the stakeholders will be required.<br/>Carrying out the Control Scope and Validate Scope processes continuously on a daily basis would be overkill and waste of resources. While controlling the scope daily may make some sense, validating scope on a daily basis may not be even possible if there is nothing to validate from the previous day.<br/></p></div></div></div></div><br/>

It reflects or mirrors the general meaning and significance of what was heard, frequently by paraphrasing.

Project managers in organizations that transition to agile methods, like the one described in the scenario, would need to transition along with the organization and switch from the command and control mode to the servant leadership approach. The project management approach in such organizations would transition from predictive, to hybrid, to agile. During the transition, the projects will likely by hybrid, and the project managers would demonstrate some behavioral patterns associated with predictive methods. However, as the organization completes the transition, the project managers would have to adapt to the new environment and switch from being in the center of the project to serving the project, team, stakeholders, and organization. Servant leaders spend their time facilitating rather than managing. Servant leaders act as peers to the team members and serve the team by providing resources and removing impediments. Servant leaders heal relationships, listen actively, and demonstrate self-awareness to ensure project success.<br/>After the transition to agile is complete, the project managers are expected to demonstrate the servant leadership approach. Being empathic, supportive, coaching, and encouraging all fall under the category of servant leadership which is all about providing the environment and resources that will keep the team nourished and productive.<br/>Transition to agile would result in project managers transitioning to servant leaders. Unlike command and control managers, servant leaders spend their time facilitating and encouraging collaboration among the team members as well as collaboration between the team members and stakeholders.<br/>With the transition to agile, both project managers and teams would need to shift their mindset from manager-subordinate relationships to peers who share responsibility. Servant leaders delegate responsibility and empower teams. Agile teams are self-organizing and self-managing and have the authority to makes decisions related to their work. Authority comes with responsibility.<br/></p></div></div></div></div><br/>

However, with the scope that cannot be defined upfront, the pure predictive approach is unlikely to work. Under these circumstances, introducing some agile elements into the scope management portion of the project may help in reducing the uncertainty. For example, instead of spending time trying to define and agree on scope early in project initiation and planning, the project team would be better off focusing on establishing the process for the ongoing discovery and refinement of the scope. Such an approach would make the project a hybrid, allowing the performing organization and the client to benefit from the best of both worlds - the certainty of the predictive planning for stable project elements and flexibility of agile for those that are less certain.<br/>Ideally, having as detailed specifications as possible at the beginning of the project would reduce uncertainty, risks, and allow for relatively easy project planning. However, according to the scenario, the client cannot provide detailed specifications at this point. Therefore, working with the client is unlikely to result in a more detailed scope.<br/>Since the client is new to the market and cannot provide detailed specifications early in project planning, establishing the process for ongoing discovery and refinement of the scope and specifications would be the best approach under the circumstances described in the scenario.<br/>There is nothing wrong with reporting the status of the known project constraints. However, under the circumstances described in the scenario and the question asking about the approach the team should select to spend its time, reporting the above status is unlikely to be the best answer.<br/></p></div></div></div></div><br/>

Decision making is a technique that can be used as part of this process. Examples include voting, in which the team members vote for the suggested duration of each activity. On agile projects, voting can take a form of the fist of five (also called fist to five). In this technique, the project manager (agile coach, scrum master, team facilitator) asks the team to show their level of support for a decision by holding up a closed fist, which would indicate no support, up to five fingers, indicating full support. If a team member holds up fewer than three fingers, the team member is given an opportunity to discuss any objections with the team. The facilitator continues the fist-of-five process until the team achieves consensus, meaning that everyone holds up three or more fingers or agrees to move on to the next decision. By incorporating the agile fist of five voting technique into the predictive Estimate Activity Durations process, the project manager moves the project closer to the hybrid one as requested by the sponsor.<br/>Mind mapping is an example of a data representation technique used to consolidate ideas created through individual brainstorming sessions into a single map to reflect commonality and differences in understanding and to generate new ideas. This technique is mainly used as part of the Collect Requirements, Plan Quality Management, and Plan Stakeholder Engagement processes. The scenario, however, implies that you are involved in the Estimate Activity Durations process.<br/>Bottom-up estimating is a method of estimating project duration or cost by aggregating the estimates of the lower-level components of the WBS. While bottom-up estimating can be used as part of the Estimate Activity Durations process implied by the scenario, this technique is closely associated with the traditional project management, as opposed to agile or hybrid as requested by the sponsor.<br/>Voting is an example of the decision making technique that can be deployed in many processes. Fist of five is a variation of the voting technique that is often used on agile projects. Therefore, incorporating an agile technique into an otherwise traditionally managed project would meet the sponsor's request of moving the organization towards the hybrid project management approach.<br/></p></div></div></div></div><br/>

Enterprise environmental factors are conditions, not under the immediate control of the team, that influence, constrain, or direct the project. Enterprise environmental factors that may be updated during the Acquire Resources process include resource availability within the organization and the amount of the organization's consumable resources that have been used. Company resources are generally not under the immediate control of the project team until they have been assigned to the project. Thus, the necessary supplemental resources in this scenario are considered enterprise environmental factors. Therefore, of the available options, updating the enterprise environmental factors is the best answer to the question asked.<br/>While keeping project stakeholders informed about the project's progress is a good practice, it is unlikely that every time resources are used for project activities, a report should be sent.

Tacit knowledge is personal and hard to express. It involves the collective know-how, techniques, and expertise gained from one's experiences. Tacit knowledge is difficult to organize and is typically shared through conversations and interactions between people. Explicit knowledge can be expressed in words, numbers, and symbols and therefore can be easily documented and shared. However, explicit knowledge lacks context and is open to different interpretations making it been easily misunderstood. You need to remember this drawback of using only explicit knowledge in order to effectively manage knowledge on this project. You need to take actions, such as building an atmosphere of trust so that people are motivated to share their knowledge, to reduce the risk of relying only on explicit knowledge.<br/>Managing project knowledge is not limited to only documenting explicit knowledge and information so it can be shared. Rather, managing project knowledge is concerned with managing 'both' explicit and tacit knowledge. While explicit knowledge can be expressed in words, numbers, and symbols allowing it to be easily documented as information, explicit knowledge lacks context and can be misunderstood. Therefore, only documenting information is not enough.<br/>Managing project knowledge is concerned with managing both tacit and explicit knowledge. Lessons learned, an example of explicit knowledge, can be easily documented. Without context, however, lessons learned can be misunderstood; therefore, there is more involved in managing project knowledge than recording lessons learned.<br/> Explicit knowledge can be expressed in words, numbers, and symbols and therefore can be easily documented.

Attendance for the project kick-off should preferably be in-person. However, in-person attendance is not always possible for economic or other reasons. In those situations, video conferencing is an acceptable alternative. When in-person attendance is possible, bringing everybody together would contribute to building relationships and conveying information. At the kick-off meeting, the participants may expect to hear about the project and product vision, which helps set expectations for those involved in the project. These discussions are most effective when the team members are together and have face-to-face communication amongst themselves and with other stakeholders. Therefore, since the company allows for one quarterly in-person meeting, bringing the team members to attend the kick-off meeting in person is the best answer to the question asked.<br/>Video conferencing is an option when teams cannot be collocated, but it is not the preferred method. While the scenario states that the team cannot be colocated for the duration of the project, the scenario does not presume the team cannot be brought together for a meeting. Hence, this choice is a good answer, but not the best of those provided.<br/>The preferred way for agile teams and stakeholders to communicate is through face-to-face interactions. This method of communicating has the highest bandwidth, transfers the most and richest form of information in a given period, and allows participants to convey their tone and non-verbal gestures.<br/>Recording the meeting makes little sense. The whole idea of the kick-off meeting is to bring the team and key project stakeholders together and discuss their roles and responsibilities as well as the project mission, vision, deliverables, high-level schedule, risks, and other high-level information. It's the opportunity for the participants to get to know each other and create the initial bond that would help contribute to project success.

Allowing the team member to work remotely temporarily is the best solution of the available answer choices as it would have the least impact on project performance. There is not enough information in the question to determine if the colocation is mandatory per company policy. Therefore, organizing the project members as a virtual team to keep the project on track should have priority over a preference for colocation for greater effectiveness. Note, when only one team member works remotely, calling the entire team virtual can be a stretch. However, of the choices provided, organizing the project team members as a virtual team is the best answer to the question asked.<br/>The French translation is reasonably assumed to be part of the project scope, and the question states you want to keep the project on track. Delaying the release may cause the project to be unsuccessful in achieving its objectives.<br/>Procuring the work to produce the French translation would unnecessarily increase the expense of the project and will likely negatively affect the project schedule. Of the available choices, this is not the best solution if you want to keep the project on track.<br/>The question states that the team member will be unable to drive for three weeks. It is unlikely that a replacement can be acquired and brought up to speed in that time frame, especially if, according to the scenario described, you want to keep the project on track.<br/></p></div></div></div></div><br/>

The idea presented in the scenario is to introduce a mature organization with an established project management methodology that is faced with unknown requirements while developing a product that overall has a clear goal - to intercept missiles. In these circumstances, and considering the experience of the contractor with the predictive project management methodologies, the known part of the project can be managed traditionally, while the development and testing of the system itself will likely need to be approached incrementally, with multiple tests, early and frequent feedback, and subsequent adaptations. In other words, a hybrid project management approach, a combination of traditional and agile, would work best for this project.<br/>When it comes to describing a project management approach, the terms ""predictive"" and ""traditional"" are often used interchangeably. Therefore, the combination of predictive and traditional makes little sense. Additionally, the predictive/traditional approach is best for projects with well-known requirements. The scenario, however, describes a system that will have to be frequently adapted, thus making the predictive/traditional approach for the entire project less suitable.<br/>According to the scenario, the contractor has an established predictive project methodology. Therefore, elements that are well-defined upfront can be managed traditionally. However, due to the new type of missiles, the anti-missile system will need to be adapted as the project progresses.

When using the Kanban method, teams need to have a common definition of when a task or user story is complete. For example, programmers may need to address edge cases before handing off a feature to the next stage for testing. Additionally, Kanban best practices call for limiting work in progress, and the team may need to establish ground rules to support this practice. For example, an agreement might be reached to always take items in the furthest righthand column of the Kanban board to bring user stories to completion as quickly as possible, or perhaps establish work in progress limits for each column on the board. Therefore, having the team revise their team charter to cover these points, which are not typically relevant for a team charter when a pure waterfall model is being used, should address the conflict described by the question.<br/>The project schedule is a project document that displays linked activities with planned dates, durations, milestones, and resources. While the scenario indicates the work in progress in increasing, this information is insufficient to determine if the project schedule needs to be updated.<br/>An agile team charter typically includes elements such as defining what ""done"" means so the team can judge completeness consistently. Additionally, the team charter may provide agreements for limiting work in progress so that user stories can be driven to completion as quickly as possible.<br/>The resource calendar is a project document that identifies the working days and shifts upon which each specific resource is available. The question describes a situation where team members cannot agree on the definition of done and have many partially complete user stories, which has nothing to do with resource availability.<br/></p></div></div></div></div><br/>

Crashing a project always involves increased cost, but according to the CPI of 1.3, the project is operating under budget. Therefore, of the choices provided, this is the best solution.<br/>Fast tracking a project is a technique used to shorten the project schedule. Activities that are usually completed in the sequence are performed in parallel. Fast tracking a project may result in increased risk and rework. Since some of your key stakeholders feel the project is already risky, increasing the risk would not be the best choice for schedule compression in this scenario. Therefore, this is not the best answer.<br/>Reducing the scope would likely reduce the schedule variance; however, it cannot be done unilaterally.

One of them is the way the change is managed. With predictive projects, requirements are mainly known up-front, and most of the planning is done in detail as early in the project life cycle as possible. This approach reduces the need for change as the project progresses, and therefore when a change is requested, it is unwelcome and constrained. Agile projects, on the other hand, are characterized by unclear requirements and, therefore, encourage change at any time during the project life cycle. When change is requested on an agile project, the product backlog is updated and reprioritized. If the change gets the highest priority, it will be incorporated as soon as possible. Everything in between is defined as a hybrid project life cycle. With hybrid projects, the change can be incorporated as needed; however, not immediately. On hybrid projects, the product is delivered in subsets; therefore, changes will likely be allowed at periodic intervals that are aligned with the beginning of the work on the next subset. Therefore, incorporating changes at periodic intervals constitutes the best answer to the question asked.<br/>On projects carried out using the predictive project management approach requirements are mainly known up-front, and most of the planning is done in detail early in the project life cycle, thus reducing the need for change as the project progresses. Therefore, in such projects, changes are discouraged and constrained as much as possible. This answer choice describes the change management approach for predictive rather than hybrid projects.<br/>Unlike predictive projects where changes are constrained as much as possible or agile projects where changes are welcome and incorporated as often as needed, hybrid projects combine the elements of both. The change is allowed, but controlled and incorporated at periodic intervals.<br/>This answer choice is unlikely to be correct for any type of project life cycle as postponing changes until after project completion means no change will be implemented during project execution. Even in the most rigid predictive projects, some change, although unwelcome, is allowed.<br/></p></div></div></div></div><br/>

</div></div> </div></div></div><div class='answer'><a class='ans' onclick='showHide(259)'>Ans</a><p style='display:none;' id='ans_259'>2--The scenario suggests that a hybrid project management approach is being employed with the hardware being developed predictively and the software incorporating an incremental approach with short feedback loops. It seems, though, as if the expectations of the team members for the frequently changing software requirements have not been properly set. When requirements are not well understood and cannot be well-defined upfront, agile approaches tend to be more effective because they use incremental development and short feedback loops. However, projects without well-defined requirements can tend to be more chaotic as the rate of change is accelerated. Project teams that have become comfortable with a waterfall approach may become frustrated with the lack of structure and evolving requirements of an agile approach. An important aspect of servant leadership is the skilled use of emotional intelligence. Servant leaders need to have the ability to be self-aware of their own emotions and reflect positive behaviors and attitudes as those characteristics tend to be adopted by the team. When the team expresses their frustrations, the servant leader needs to be able to absorb the frustration without allowing it to affect their emotional state negatively.<br/>

Note, ideally, the expectations of project stakeholders (including the team members) should have been set up in advance to account for the different approaches selected for the development of the hardware portion of the project versus the software one. Setting up the expectations upfront would have eliminated (or at least decreased) the level of frustration the team members experience while facing various levels of clarity or ambiguity of requirements for different parts of the project.<br/>Sometimes, ignoring a problem could be a plausible answer choice. Typically, this response is more applicable to minor problems. This scenario, however, is worded in a way that presents the team's frustration as a significant problem that should not be ignored.<br/>A project manager should use their emotional intelligence to absorb the team's frustration while maintaining a positive attitude.<br/>The question implies that the project is using an agile framework for software development.

Upper and lower specification limits are based on the requirements and reflect the maximum, and minimum values allowed. Upper and lower control limits are different from specification limits. The control limits are determined using standard statistical calculations and principles to establish the natural capability for a stable process. The project manager and appropriate stakeholders may use the control limits to identify points at which corrective action should be taken to prevent performance that remains outside the control limits. In this scenario, one of the parts has a thickness of 4.1 mm which is below the lower control limit (LCL) of 4.2 mm; therefore, the process is out of control, and corrective action should be taken.<br/>

The topic of this question is only briefly mentioned in the PMBOK® Guide. However, the Project Management Professional (PMP)® Examination Content Outline (ECO) indicates that while there are some commonalities between the PMBOK® Guide and the ECO, the exam is not bound by the PMBOK® Guide. The list of enablers specified in the tasks of the ECO domains is not exhaustive either. The ECO assumes that prospective PMP aspirants are familiar with other sources of information/preparation, including but not limited to PMI Code of Ethics and Professional Conduct, PMI’s Practice Standards (e.g., Scheduling, Earned Value Management, etc.); organizational behavior theories such as Tuckman’s Ladder, Theory X and Theory Y, Maslow's hierarchy of needs; commonly frowned upon project management practices, such as gold plating; and others. We intentionally have these questions in our simulator so that you would be better prepared for the real exam. PMP aspirants are encouraged to explore additional sources of information and/or to be familiar with them from their project management experience.<br/>The specification limits are set at 4 mm and 5 mm. However, the control limits indicated on the control chart are set at 4.2 mm and 4.8 mm. While the thickness of all the parts meets the specification limits, the process is out of control because one of the parts measured below the lower control limit (LCL) at 4.1 mm.<br/>According to the chart provided in the question, the lower control limit (LCL) is set at 4.2 mm. Since one of the parts is below the LCL with a thickness of 4.1 mm, the process is considered out of control, and corrective action should be taken.<br/>The rule of seven states that a process is considered out of control if seven consecutive data points fall above or below the mean. In this case, the distribution around the mean of 4.5 mm appears random, and there are not seven consecutive data points falling on one side of the mean.<br/></p></div></div></div></div><br/>

A project leader’s primary role is to facilitate the creation of a product vision and guide the team toward making that vision a reality. Product vision drives product roadmap; the product roadmap drives release plan; the release plan establishes the iterations. The product vision is not always static and, in some cases, can be adjusted over the course of the project, especially an agile project, where requirements often and constantly change. Therefore, by re-communicating the product vision at the beginning of each iteration (or milestone), project leaders create a sense of purpose in the endeavor that will motivate people to work toward the common goal.<br/>Presenting the product vision only once at the kickoff meeting is not enough. First, there is a natural tendency for the vision to fade out over time in people's minds. Second, vision is not always static and, in some cases, can be adjusted over the course of the project, especially an agile project, where requirements often and constantly change.<br/>Although information radiators could be a reasonable choice to display the product vision, it doesn’t ensure that the team will read it every time they pass by, let alone understand and act upon it.<br/>Agile methods encourage face-to-face communication as the most efficient method of sharing information. Email is not considered a very effective communication method. It can be reasonably assumed that an email containing a product vision statement would be ignored by most of the stakeholders.<br/></p></div></div></div></div><br/>

This means the project, as a whole, will be lead using hybrid methods. An activity list is a project document that includes the activities planned to be performed on the project according to its schedule. On agile projects (or phases that utilize an agile project management approach), where a product is developed incrementally/iteratively, activities to be performed are not defined upfront during the initial project or phase planning, but rather determined before each subsequent iteration begins. In such projects/phases, therefore, it would be fair to say that the activity list is updated periodically as the project or phase progresses.<br/>The daily standup is a meeting that is typically used by project teams on agile projects to shortly report on work done, upcoming tasks, and impediments to progress if any. Re-prioritization of activities or tasks is usually done during iteration planning meetings or backlog grooming sessions rather than daily standups.<br/>The activity list is a project document that includes the schedule activities required on the project. For projects (or phases) that use agile techniques, as in the scenario described, the activities often change based on the evolving requirements and, therefore, will be updated periodically as the project progresses.<br/>On traditional projects, it is possible that activities to be carried out are revised during the planning stages of their corresponding phases. However, the question is asking about handling the activities for an agile phase. Revising the activity list only at the beginning of the phase would be insufficient since activities (tasks, user stories) on agile projects are changed with each subsequent iteration.<br/></p></div></div></div></div><br/>

Products developed incrementally in an adaptive approach by cross-functional project teams are frequently reviewed to accelerate knowledge sharing and ensure that risks are understood and managed. Risks are identified, analyzed, managed, and considered when selecting the content of each iteration. Additionally, the requirements are kept as a living document that is regularly updated. Work may be reprioritized as the project progresses, based on an improved understanding of current risk exposure. Agile teams strive to balance delivering the highest-value features and mitigating the biggest risks. They achieve this by moving the items with the greatest value and risk to the top of the backlog so that the backlog becomes risk-adjusted. Therefore, to ensure that upcoming iterations reflect the new risks and requirements, the team should reprioritize work in a risk-adjusted backlog.<br/>One of the key agile considerations for project risk management is to keep the requirements as a living document that is regularly updated. In agile terms, this list of requirements is called the project or product backlog. Based on an improved understanding of current risk exposure, work may be reprioritized as the project progresses. After such sorting takes place, the document becomes a risk-adjusted backlog.<br/>A regular retrospective meeting is an agile practice for inspecting the team's performance and collaborating on ways to minimize risk. However, a retrospective is held at the end of an iteration to reflect on team performance and adapt the process used by the team to develop the product, not to plan the next iterations.<br/> The 'requirements-risk repository' is a made-up term.<br/></p></div></div></div></div><br/>

Product development would be best served with an agile approach to provide early feedback and manage the high rate of change. However, the training manager's aspect of the project would be better suited to a predictive approach. Since the product development and the training represent two distinct stages of the project, there is no reason to force a specific approach to both stages. Each stage can adopt the project management framework that is best suited to it. Providing a compromise by adopting an agile framework for product development and a predictive model for the training should resolve the conflict and provide the best overall approach for the project.<br/>

It should be noted that the use of the compromise/reconcile conflict management technique suggests that each side is giving something up, which is not clear in this case. If by adopting the hybrid project management approach, neither party is making any sacrifice, then the collaborate/problem solve conflict resolution technique might better describe the resolution. However, from the scenario described, it cannot be determined whether or not both sides are giving anything up. Since the collaborate/problem solve technique was not offered as an answer choice, compromising is the best answer from the available options.<br/>Project managers should attempt to resolve conflicts before escalating to the project sponsor. The project manager, assuming it's not her first project, should rely on her experience to determine the appropriate project management framework. The project manager can then submit the recommendations to the project sponsor for approval, if necessary.<br/>Emphasizing the commonalities between both approaches is an example that partially describes the smooth/accommodate conflict resolution technique.

The requesting organization (client) can begin receiving benefits as soon as the first product increment is completed, accepted, and deployed. Thus, the requesting organization would not have to wait the full 18 months of the project term to begin receiving value. Creating a minimum viable product (MVP) is common practice with software development projects, as is the case in the scenario described. The MVP can be developed and released while the project is still in execution, and the benefits associated with the MVP can begin being realized. Additional features can then be developed and released as they are completed until a fully functional product with all required features is delivered.<br/>

Note, the question implies that the project will be managed using a traditional waterfall framework. However, by blending an incremental lifecycle with the waterfall model, the framework changes to hybrid. Incorporating an incremental lifecycle will require changes to the proposed project management plan. For example, the development approach portion of the project management plan will have to be updated along with other components.<br/>Fast-tracking might shorten the time to delivery. However, fast-tracking is a schedule compression technique, and the question stipulates that all schedule compression techniques have already been used to shorten the schedule.<br/>Incorporating an incremental product development approach would allow the requesting organization (client) to begin receiving benefits as soon as the first product increment is completed.<br/>Crashing is a schedule compression technique used to shorten the schedule duration by adding resources.

The risk owner uses performance information generated during the project execution to determine if implemented risk responses are effective, whether or not the status of identified risks has changed, and if project risk strategy is still valid. Therefore, to periodically report to the project manager on the effectiveness of their assigned risk response plan, the risk response owners should use the Monitor Risks process.<br/> In the Plan Risk Responses process risk owners are assigned responsibility for individual project risks and charged with identifying ways to address the risks assigned to them.

There is a conflict with the project sponsor's interest in using an agile framework and the development team insisting on a predictive approach. There are also conflicts among the team members that are severe enough that they do not even want to work together. Of the available alternatives, there is only one option that addresses both of these sources of conflict, which is the answer choice for selecting a hybrid project management framework.<br/>

When selecting a project management framework, many factors must be considered, including the nature of the project, the structure of the team, and the culture. Even if the project and team structure are well-suited to an agile approach, we cannot ignore the attitudes of the project team members. If the development team has a high level of resistance to a specific methodology, for whatever reason, the risk of project failure increases. An effective project manager must balance all of these constraints to select the best approach for a particular project.<br/>

The conflict between the project team and the project sponsor can be resolved by adopting a hybrid approach. The project sponsor's interest in agile methodologies is specifically to achieve early revenue generation through incremental delivery. The development team wants to work independently and have tasks assigned to them rather than collaborating to complete the project work. Even though the development team is advocating for a predictive approach, their goals can still be achieved with a hybrid approach. With a hybrid approach, the project could be structured to provide incremental delivery while at the same time, allowing the development team members to work independently and have their tasks assigned to them.<br/>

The conflict resolution technique being applied to address the conflict between the project sponsor and the project team might be considered compromise/reconcile or collaborate/problem solve, depending on whether or not each side is giving something up (which is not entirely clear in this case). The conflict resolution technique that is being applied in the scenario to address the conflict within the project team would best be described as withdraw/avoidance since allowing the project team members to work independently should avoid conflict that might arise from their interactions.<br/>

One might argue that it would be better to actually address the conflict within the project team first rather than just avoiding it, which is certainly a fair point. However, none of the available answer choices provide a potential solution to the internal strife among the team members. Therefore, of the available choices, adopting a hybrid approach to address both sources of conflict is the best answer course of action for the project manager.<br/>The sponsor may have the power to dictate the project management framework. However, it is likely that the sponsor is to be more interested in the success of the project rather than a particular project management approach. With the project team's lack of buy-in for an agile model, forcing it on the team would increase the risk of project failure.<br/>A hybrid approach would provide the opportunity for early revenue generation through incremental delivery as requested by the sponsor while allowing the project team members to work independently with individually assigned tasks.<br/>Agile methodologies require greater collaboration among the project team members. A predictive approach may still require some collaboration but will likely be lesser than in agile. With a predictive approach, tasks can be individually assigned, and project team members can work more independently. While adopting a predictive approach might reduce the conflict among the project team members, it does not address the project sponsor's interest in early revenue from incremental delivery.<br/></p></div></div></div></div><br/>

The stair-stepped line on the graph represents the funding requirements that include the cost baseline and the management reserve. The project budget is represented by the last point of the stair-step line. The question states that EAC (estimate at completion) is less than the project budget (the top stair step). Therefore, in this scenario, total funding for the project exceeds the project's anticipated needs.<br/>

One may argue that if EAC is higher than BAC, a project is always referred to as ""over budget"". This is a common misconception. Original BAC is the cost baseline (the overall project budget, excluding the management reserve). When the overall actual costs at the project completion are higher than the original BAC, then the project is indeed considered over budget. However, as the project progresses, costs are continuously monitored. When at any point throughout the project's life cycle it becomes evident that the project cannot be completed within the originally planned BAC, a new estimation is determined and, once approved, becomes the new ""budget at completion"". However, to avoid confusion, it's no longer called BAC. It's called estimate at completion, EAC. Therefore, the EAC becomes the newly approved budget, or more accurately, the new cost baseline, which is the overall project budget, excluding the management reserve. Hence, when actual costs are under or equal to the EAC, the project is considered under or on budget.<br/>The stair-step line is the funding limit reconciliation line, and the highest point is the last amount of money released to the project. This amount includes management reserve and represents the entire project budget. Since the project budget is higher on the chart than the EAC, the project is running under, not over budget.<br/>The management reserve is established to address unknown project risks. The management reserve is only one component of the overall project budget. In this scenario, all that can be surmised is that the project budget, represented by the last point of the stair-step line, exceeds the EAC. There is no information presented by the question to suggest that the management reserve is excessive.<br/>The stair-stepped line on the graph represents the project's funding requirements. The project budget is represented by the last point of the stair-step line. Therefore, the estimate at completion is less than the project budget, meaning total funding for the project exceeds the project's anticipated needs.<br/></p></div></div></div></div><br/>

It will not be useful to base your adjustments on past performance, because, as a result of the significant turnover described in the question, a substantial part of the team consists of new members.<br/>By conducting team evaluations, the project manager can determine the specific training, coaching, and mentoring needs of the team members.

While voting, as a decision-making technique, is not specified among the tools and techniques of the Direct and Manage Project Work process, prospective PMP aspirants have to remember that the PMBOK® Guide does not prescribe or limit usage of specific tools or techniques while carrying out specific processes. Voting is an effective decision-making technique that can be used in the Direct and Manage Project Work process to make decisions that will help gain the commitment of the team members such as in the situation described in the question. Since the discussion has reached an impasse, the project manager should guide the team to decide on the best way to implement the approved change request.

Allowing the discussions to continue at this point would be counterproductive.<br/>The question states that the project team members have had a lengthy discussion about the best way to implement the approved change request. Regardless of the informality, this scenario describes a meeting which has reached an impasse. Since a meeting has not been an effective tool in determining the best course of action, the project manager should take another approach.<br/>The situation described in the scenario does not seem to be severe enough to trigger escalation to the project sponsor.

Managing the vast amount of project knowledge and the lessons that are constantly learned by all project stakeholders throughout the project enables the project team to leverage that knowledge and apply it. Applying lessons learned and project knowledge supports the project organization, the project outcomes, and operation of the current and future projects. Documenting the knowledge into a lesson learned register is one method of capturing that knowledge to ensure it is not lost. Applying that knowledge to the project is even more beneficial. There is a misconception that projects must wait until the end of a project in order to document it. Just accepting mistakes happened is not enough. Knowledge is fluid and best shared and used at the point it is most needed.<br/>Mistakes happen on projects all the time. It is important that the project team understands their mistakes and how to correct or avoid repeating them in the future. Proceeding to the next iteration as planned without taking any action to correct the mistakes is unlikely to be the best choice in this situation.<br/>The lessons learned repository is a store of historical information about the lessons learned from projects. The lessons learned repository is typically updated at the end of the project/phase as part of project/phase closure. It is unclear from the scenario provided if the project has entered the Close Project or Phase process. Therefore, updating the lessons learned repository may be premature.<br/>The project knowledge and the lessons learned are most useful when applied. This knowledge may be explicit and immediately applicable or could be tacit and subtly influence the decisions and actions at any point throughout the project.<br/></p></div></div></div></div><br/>

</div></div> </div></div></div><div class='answer'><a class='ans' onclick='showHide(282)'>Ans</a><p style='display:none;' id='ans_282'>3--Little’s law is an important concept used to help project teams analyze and minimize work in progress (WIP) when implementing a Kanban board to manage workflow on an agile project. Little’s law is a mathematical proof developed by John D.C. Little that states that ""the more things you have going at the same time, the longer each thing will take."" To understand the formula, let's break down the different parts of it and describe what each variable means:

Cycle Time = Work in progress / Throughput

Cycle time is the time through the progress for each item. Work in progress (WIP) is the number of items the team works on at the same time. Throughput is the average time it takes the team to complete each item. Eventually, the cycle time represents the duration from the time the team starts working on a task until the team completes the task. From the scenario described, it seems as if the stakeholder used the formula to calculate the cycle time in the previous project as well and, after comparing the two, concluded that the cycle time in the current project is longer than the cycle time in the previous project. This information, however, is not required to answer the question correctly and is provided to make a realistic scenario. In general, it is possible and very likely that different projects will have different characteristics and KPIs. Cycle time is one of them.<br/>

Note, cycle time is different from lead time. Lead time is the overall time that passes from the moment the work item is placed on the board until the item is delivered to the customer. Lead time is always longer than the cycle time because work items are typically waiting in the first column (e.g., the ""To Do"" column) before being pulled by a team member to be worked on. Then, after the item is done and ready to be delivered, it is possible that the item would wait in the ""Done"" column for various reasons before it's actually delivered to the customer.<br/>The numerator and denominator have been transposed in this choice, making it an incorrect answer. The correct formula to be applied to calculate the cycle time using Little's Law is work in progress divided by throughput.<br/>Earned value divided by actual costs results in the cost performance index (CPI), not cycle time. The CPI is typically used on traditional projects to measure the cost efficiency of budgeted resources.<br/>This answer choice represents the correct formula for cycle time used in Little's Law. The work in progress is the number of items the team works on at the same time, and the throughput is the average time it takes the team to complete each item.<br/></p></div></div></div></div><br/>

Of the choices provided, only the file labeled 'administrative closure' most closely resembles the formal term of the administrative closure of the project. All the other files describe activities carried out prior to closing.<br/>

Note, 'administrative closure' is mentioned only once in the reference provided and may not necessarily ""ring a bell"" as far as project closure is concerned. Therefore, one of the techniques to answer the questions on the PMP exam where the correct answer does not ""jump"" at you or cannot be unequivocally supported is by excluding implausible answer choices.<br/>Verified deliverables is an output of the Control Quality process that is then used as input to the Validate Scope process. Acknowledgment of the verified deliverables must, therefore, take place before the Validate Scope process, and since the Validate Scope process is not part of project closing described in the scenario, this choice is an incorrect answer.<br/>Project exit criteria are typically included in the project charter to determine what conditions need to be met in order to close or to cancel the project or phase. As a result, the project exit criteria would be established during initiating processes, and since the scenario suggests the Close Project or Phase process is underway, this answer choice is incorrect.<br/>Closed procurements provide the seller with formal written notice that the contract has been completed. First, there is no indication in the scenario that vendors worked on the project. Even if they did, closed procurements is an output of the Control Procurements process in the Monitoring and Controlling Process Group. Since the scenario implies the project is in closure, this answer choice can be eliminated.<br/></p></div></div></div></div><br/>

Determining the story points at issue will not likely resolve the underlying source of the conflict. Given the extreme nature of the conflict, the scrum master should intervene in an attempt to address the issue. Additionally, a severe and complex issue such as the one described in this scenario cannot realistically be resolved during a meeting. Therefore, the best course of action for the scrum master is to dismiss the meeting and meet with the developers privately to try and uncover the underlying source of conflict and attempt a resolution.<br/>Before a resolution can be reached, the scrum master must first understand the underlying source of the conflict, which is not likely to be accomplished in the middle of a meeting.

On such a project, stakeholders are usually involved in major milestones and gates. As long as the project is in initiation and planning, the ability of stakeholders to influence the final characteristics of the project's product, without significantly impacting cost and schedule, is at its highest level, and, therefore, the cost of changes is the lowest. As the project progresses and deliverables are completed, stakeholder influence decreases, while the cost of changes increases. When the project approaches its end and the deliverables are completed and accepted, the cost of making changes and correcting errors increases substantially. Therefore, of the choices provided, the cost of making changes is at its highest during project closure.<br/>Area A represents project initiation. On traditionally managed projects, the cost of changes during project initiation is very low since no deliverables are produced. Change requests are not even required during project initiation since no plans exist at that point. The project charter, if one exists, does not require an approved change to be modified.<br/>Area B represents project planning. On traditionally managed projects, project planning typically involves the development of the project management plan. No deliverables are produced during project planning. An approved change request will only be required if some or all of the components of the project management plan are approved. The cost to change a component of the project management plan is considered low.<br/>Area C represents project execution as well as the main activities to monitor and control project work. The focus of the project during execution is producing the project deliverables. Any modification to a project deliverable requires an approved change request. The cost of changes during project execution depends on various factors and, generally speaking, is higher than during project initiation and/or planning, but lower than during project closure.<br/></p></div></div></div></div><br/>

When conflict arises, which becomes a negative factor or issue, the project team members are initially responsible for resolving the issue. If the team members fail to resolve their differences, it is the responsibility of the project manager to become involved and attempt to facilitate a solution. Using a force/direct approach, which involves pushing one's viewpoint at the expense of others results in a win-lose situation and may have a negative impact on the team if facilitation and compromise are not attempted first.<br/>The question doesn't indicate the situation is critical or that the project manager has already attempted to facilitate a solution. When conflict arises, and the team members haven't been able to make progress themselves, it is the responsibility of the project manager to become involved and attempt to facilitate a solution.<br/>The question doesn't indicate the situation is critical or that the project manager has attempted to facilitate a solution so at this point it would be premature for the project manager to force a decision or make the decision independent of a discussion between the two project members.

One aspect is leadership style. The transition from traditional methods to hybrid to agile will first have to ensure that the company management understands and accepts the fact that they themselves and those managers reporting to them will have to undergo a significant shift in their mindset before the transition of the project management approach may take place. An important hybrid/agile concept to consider here is that of a leadership-collaboration management style, also referred to as servant leadership. This agile leadership style differs from the command-and-control top-down management style that is often seen on traditional projects. Commanders know the objective while leaders grasp the direction. Commanders dictate while leaders influence. Controllers demand while collaborators facilitate. Controllers micro-manage while collaborators encourage. Managers who embrace the leadership-collaboration model understand that their primary responsibilities are to set direction, provide guidance, and facilitate work. Command and control top-down managers tend to dictate, demand, and micro-manage. Agile leaders influence, facilitate, set direction, and provide guidance.<br/>Assigning tasks to the team, monitoring and controlling project work is typical for command and control top-down managers who are used to dictate, force, assign, monitor and control. This management style is unlikely to result in a successful transition to hybrid and agile.<br/>On agile projects, the product backlog is the responsibility of a product owner. While the product owner is considered an agile leader, the essence of the question surrounds the change from command and control top-down management approach to agile servant leadership. Managing the backlog does not reflect this change.<br/>This answer choice represents the most likely transition from command and control top-down managers in traditionally led projects to servant leaders in hybrid and agile environments.<br/></p></div></div></div></div><br/>

This is the skill set representing those skills of effectively applying the project management knowledge and competencies to achieve project objectives. Although, PMI has determined from studies that there are two equally important skills that a project manager should have in balance: strategic and business skills, and leadership skills. Project managers can demonstrate leadership skills in a variety of ways, especially when dealing with people and teams. At its core, leadership skills manifest themselves in a project manager's ability to guide, direct, motivate, and build project teams to meet their potentials and the goals of the project.<br/>Reducing stress from the team is part of the everyday role and expectation of a project manager as a servant leader regardless of whether the project is struggling or not. Leadership requires more than just working with the executives to ease the stress from the team.<br/>While technical skills and knowledge are important to project management, typically, a project manager would not analyze and resolve technical issues. The project manager's time is better spent guiding, motivating, and supporting the team. Additionally, technical skills are not leadership skills but represent the abilities to comprehend the project work and perform project management duties.<br/>Leadership skills of project managers can be demonstrated in many ways.

Thus, the project manager is wise to be concerned about how these cultural differences will impact communications. The project manager's best course of action, in this scenario, is to help the team develop their cultural awareness by enrolling everyone in cultural training. Cultural awareness is an understanding of the differences between individuals, groups, and organizations and adapting the communications in the context of these differences. This awareness and any consequent actions may help minimize misunderstandings and miscommunication that may result from cultural differences within the project team. Therefore, among the available choices, enrolling the project team members in cultural training to raise cultural awareness is what the project manager should do first.<br/>With this mix of cultures, it could be very easy for people to offend one another unintentionally.

A typical burndown chart tracks the number of story points completed in an iteration or a release. In this scenario, during the iteration retrospective meeting, the project manager and team are analyzing the burndown chart of the recently completed iteration. The goal of the iteration retrospective is to reflect on the work performed and improve the process going forward. Burndown charts can help analyze the team's velocity. Identifying gaps in velocity and finding the reason for being unable to meet the iteration goal may provide insight into what could be improved. For example, when the actual velocity is equal to the planned one, the curve of the story points remaining to be completed overlaps the curve of the planned work. When the velocity is slower than planned, the curves diverge. When the team completes work faster than planned, the slope of the curve of the remaining work is steeper than the planned curve.<br/>

According to the iteration burndown chart presented in the scenario, right off the start, during the first 2.5 days, the curve of the story points remained to be completed was diverging from the plan, meaning the team's velocity was lower than the one needed to complete the work planned for those days. From the middle of day 3 till the middle of day 5, for whatever reason, the team completed no story points at all. As the iteration progressed, the team's velocity varied and the number of the story points remaining to be completed went down. However, at some point during that period (on day 7), the gap between planned and actual work was at its maximum value of nearly 15 story points, significantly diverging from the plan. Although towards the end of the iteration the team members were able to catch up a bit, yet they failed to close the gap entirely, thus missing the iteration goal.<br/>

Note, no calculation is required to answer this question. All is needed, is a simple visual analysis of the burndown chart.<br/>Area A represents approximately the first 2.5 days of the 10-day iteration. At the beginning of the first day, the number of story points planned is the largest and equal to the number of story points remaining to be completed. Therefore, the number of story points actually completed is zero. By the end of the period represented by area A, the team has completed approximately 5 story points, while it should have completed about 8. However, this gap is still the smallest of those the team accumulated during any other periods throughout the iteration.<br/>Area B represents approximately the next 2 days of the iteration. The exact number of days in this area is not important. What important is that the curve of the story points remaining to be completed is flat, meaning the team did not complete any work at all. Finding the reason for why this occurred may help the team improve the process going forward<br/>Area C represents the longest period of the iteration, approximately 4 days. During this period, the team accumulated the largest gap between the planned and actual work. For example, one can see that on days 7 and 8, the gap was around 15 story points. During this period, however, the team has completed the largest amount of work, between 15 to 20 story points.<br/></p></div></div></div></div><br/>

Facilitating a meeting at the start of the project to establish the team's working agreements will be critically important for a team that has not worked together previously. The team's working agreements are created and agreed upon by the project team. The team charter will document how the team will work together and set standards of behavior for things such as core hours. Had the agile coach facilitated a meeting to create a social contract, the issues described by the question might have been avoided, and this action is consistent with agile best practices.<br/>Agile teams are self-organizing, and agile coaches should avoid mandating how the team goes about their work.

Towards the end of the project, during the Validate Scope process, the deliverables are inspected, compared to the acceptance criteria, and then accepted or rejected. However, with an agile project, or when the product of the project is developed incrementally as described by the scenario, the product increments produced at the end of each iteration are demonstrated by the project team to the relevant project stakeholders during the iteration review meetings. The deliverables are reviewed by the product owner and relevant stakeholders and either approved or rejected. Next iteration begins, another product increment is developed, and the iteration review is held. The product increment is reviewed and either approved or rejected. The process repeats itself with each consecutive iteration. Therefore, under the circumstances described in this particular scenario, validation and acceptance of the project deliverables will occur incrementally throughout the project.<br/>The iteration retrospectives relate to continuous improvement efforts. It is the iteration reviews and not iteration retrospectives that are used to validate and accept the deliverables that meet the acceptance criteria.<br/>Activities associated with project closure typically cover administrative tasks. The actual review and acceptance of the deliverables occur earlier in the project, as part of the Validate Scope process, not Close Project or Phase process. It's the confirmation of the acceptance (not the acceptance itself) that happens during project closure.<br/>Unless specifically mentioned in the scenario, this answer choice can be eliminated as it represents a highly unlikely and unrealistic scenario.<br/></p></div></div></div></div><br/>

</div></div> </div></div></div><div class='answer'><a class='ans' onclick='showHide(302)'>Ans</a><p style='display:none;' id='ans_302'>4--The performing organization's human resource management policies regarding hiring and termination represent one of the enterprise environmental factors (EEFs) which may influence the Develop Team process implied by the scenario. The human resource management policies and procedures should provide guidance on the criteria as well as the steps which must be taken in order to terminate an employee's employment. Therefore, of the available choices, before taking any action regarding the team member's employment, you should first review the enterprise environmental factors, specifically, the human resource management policies that specify hiring and termination procedures.<br/>

One may argue that policies and procedures are organizational process assets (OPAs). While this is correct, the list of the OPAs and EEFs provided at the beginning of the PMBOK® Guide is not exhaustive. Specific examples of the OPAs and EEFs are given in the chapters relevant to a specific process. For example, the human resource management policies regarding hiring and termination mentioned above are not listed among the EEFs in the EEFs chapter. However, as specified in the reference provided, the Develop Team process chapter provides these policies as one of the inputs to the process. We believe the reason being is that policies and procedures that specify how the organization hires and terminates their employees are not under the control of the project team. Being not under the control of the project team is what EEFs typically are.<br/>Reprimanding the employee in front of the team will likely equal to disclosing personal information, which goes against acceptable best project management practices.<br/> While you may need to communicate with the informant, doing so should not be your first step. You should first understand the organizational policies and procedures in such cases, notably the hiring and termination procedures. It may also provide guidance on communications and privacy. For example, you may not be allowed to share your findings with the informant.<br/>You may very well have cause to terminate the employee in this scenario. However, before taking this action, you should first review the organization's policies and procedures for terminating employment. Failing to do so may expose the organization to legal liability.<br/></p></div></div></div></div><br/>

The output of each iteration will be an increment of the product. The project team will need to ensure that the product meets all of the requirements for regulatory approval. While the governmental regulatory body is only concerned with the final product, the project team should still verify that each product increment meets any requirements specific to that product increment. Deliverables (even interim deliverables) are verified as part of the Control Quality process. If the Control Quality process uncovers a nonconformance issue, it is best to discover that issue during the iteration so that steps can be taken to avoid the issue in future product increments. Waiting until after the complete product has been developed to verify it meets requirements will increase the risk of rework and may delay the project.<br/>The iteration planning meeting is a collaborative event in which the team plans the work that will be completed during the iteration.

</div></div> </div></div></div><div class='answer'><a class='ans' onclick='showHide(306)'>Ans</a><p style='display:none;' id='ans_306'>4--Project management best practices advocate for problem-solving and collaboration when it comes to resolving issues or conflicts, as it is a win-win conflict resolution technique that typically leads to greater buy-in and the most lasting solution. The 'collaborate/problem-solve' approach emphasizes open dialogue, cooperation, and incorporating multiple viewpoints to find the best outcome for the project. In this scenario, the project manager sends the project team on a fact-finding mission, which is a good way to help the team discuss the issue more objectively. Getting the team together in a problem-solving session to present their ideas and work out a solution is more likely to satisfy both sides and keep the team unified; therefore, the 'Collaborate/Problem Solve' approach is the 'best' answer choice. All other approaches are temporary solutions resulting in recurring conflicts.<br/>This is an example of the 'Force/Direct' approach to resolving a conflict. Forcing a solution on the team is a win-lose scenario and will likely divide the team rather than unite it. Disciplinary actions are not warranted at this stage since project team members are entitled to have differences of opinion, which when managed properly can result in greater productivity and positive working relationships. If project team members cannot resolve a conflict situation on their own, a project manager should help facilitate a satisfactory resolution before taking disciplinary action.<br/>This is an example of the 'Smooth/Accommodate' approach to conflict resolution. Emphasizing areas of agreement between warring sides can help diffuse conflict situations but leave the real issue buried. Urging one side to back down simply to maintain the peace puts maintaining harmony within the group above finding the best solution to the problem. This approach is not very satisfying and could lead to breakdowns in trust.<br/>This sounds like a nice answer, but 'Compromise/Reconcile' is a lose-lose conflict resolution technique because each side has to give up something to reach a solution, meaning that no one gets what they wanted. This only partially or temporarily resolves the conflict and therefore is not the best choice.<br/></p></div></div></div></div><br/>

Programs are managed by program managers who ensure that program benefits are delivered as expected by coordinating the activities of a program's components. In this scenario, with three projects ahead of schedule and one well behind, it may make sense for the program manager to reallocate some resources to ensure that all four locations can be opened on time. Therefore, of the available choices, escalating the issue to the program manager is the best answer.<br/>The question does not indicate that the scope for any of the projects is being increased.

Another answer choice more accurately addresses the question asked.<br/>The four projects and project managers are being managed in a coordinated manner, which suggests that they are being managed by a program manager.

The circumstances in this scenario are that there is a time sensitivity but lots of unknowns. Without clear knowledge of what needs to be done and how, deciding as a team all that needs to be done before started is difficult. Attempting to fully define the project work before starting work may be more time consuming compared to starting with a roadmap and some less clear requirements. Building off lesser requirements and gathering feedback and input provides fodder for the stakeholders to work from and define the scope further. This agile approach to project management enables stakeholders to progressively elaborate the project's outcomes and plans to achieve those outcomes.<br/>Time is of the essence, and too much is unknown. The stakeholders do not fully understand the scope that is needed or desired. Spending too much time debating the unknowns might corner the project in an unviable solution. Ensuring all stakeholders are in agreement on the product and project scope that is unknown is unlikely to be the best approach for the project manager to take in this situation.<br/>Based on the scenario described, the project scope is not fully understood and still evolving. Adopting an agile project management approach to this project better suits the stakeholders' need to flesh out the product and outcomes.<br/>In traditional project management, the team is typically acquired during project execution. However, a project consisting of many unknown requirements would benefit from the early input, feedback, and perspectives of subject matter experts and team members who are going to plan and execute the project. Therefore, stabilizing the primary project requirements before any project team members are acquired will likely delay the project which, as implied by the scenario, is already under the time constraint.<br/></p></div></div></div></div><br/>

It is likely to be a long and, sometimes, painful process. If appropriately implemented, the project management approach will gradually shift from traditional to hybrid to agile. The first step, transitioning from predictive to hybrid, can be done by incorporating some of the agile elements into the existing predictive practices. Of the options provided, only incorporating the daily standup meetings into the current practices used by the project teams represents an agile practice. The rest of the answer choices are tools, techniques, or processes associated with traditional project management. The way the scenario is worded makes it sound as if the vendor provided four different valid options for the transition. However, for the purpose of the exam preparation, three of the answer choices are intentionally incorrect.<br/>A traditional project management approach is characterized by relatively stable requirements that allow project teams to develop initial plans with a high level of detail. Increasing the level of detail would hold the organization within the current predictive project management framework rather than move it closer to the agile one.<br/>The daily standup is a meeting that is used by project teams that typically work on agile projects. Adding this practice to a daily routine of the teams that work on predictive projects may help the organization with its transition from the predictive to agile project management approach, as requested by the executive in the scenario described.<br/>It is 'how', not with how 'many' stakeholders, the project progress is shared, is what determines the project management approach used on the project. On traditional projects, project progress is typically shared using periodic meetings and reports. On agile projects, the project's progress is readily available in the form of information radiators.<br/></p></div></div></div></div><br/>

It is important for the team to be shielded from distractions to enable them to focus on creating high-value products and fulfilling their commitment. The ceremonies and information radiators serve to provide status information to stakeholders. In this case, it is best that the agile coach explain to the stakeholder that unnecessary calls and emails requesting for status are not helpful and interrupt the development team from doing the work. In addition, the agile coach should educate the stakeholder about the information radiators that the team is using to communicate the status of the project to the organization such as burndown or burnup charts.<br/>It's one of the duties of the agile coach as a servant leader to shield the team from unnecessary distractions. Talking directly to the stakeholder may resolve the issue. If this approach does not help, then escalating the issue to the project sponsor may be the next logical step.<br/>The agile coach should contact the project stakeholder and guide, coach, and educate them about the proper channels to use to address their need for project status.<br/>Since the stakeholder is not contacting the development team about additional features or prioritization of backlog items for which the product owner is primarily responsible, it is not appropriate for the coach to ask the product owner to respond to the stakeholder's inquiries.<br/></p></div></div></div></div><br/>

</div></div> </div></div></div><div class='answer'><a class='ans' onclick='showHide(312)'>Ans</a><p style='display:none;' id='ans_312'>4--Ideally, agile team members are colocated and 100% dedicated to the team and project. However, having all team members 100% dedicated to the project is not always possible. The main problem with partially dedicated team members is multitasking and task switching. Multitasking reduces the throughput of the team's work and impacts the team's ability to predict the constant delivery of value to the customer. Multitasking slows the process of the entire team because team members waste time by context switching and/or waiting for each other to finish work. Since the scenario is talking about the company's imposed constraints, there is little you can do to increase the availability of the team members to your project. Therefore, of the choices provided, adjusting assignments based on individual capacity is the best answer to the question asked.<br/>

Notes, in agile, tasks are not assigned to the team members, but rather pulled by the team members. However, the correct answer choice does not go into the details as to how tasks are assigned, but rather provides a general idea of what should be done when team members are not 100% dedicated to the project.<br/>Scrum is one of the agile methods. This choice is ambiguous and misleading intentionally.<br/>The iteration length is set up at the beginning of an agile project. The length is determined based on what makes the most sense from the product and development perspective. Increasing the iteration length would not increase the availability of those team members who are not 100% dedicated to the project.<br/>Principle #8 of the Agile Manifesto states, ""Agile processes promote sustainable development. The sponsors, developers, and users should be able to maintain a constant pace indefinitely."" While working overtime may be required for short periods of time (and has to be rewarded), this practice should not be a norm for the duration of the project. This choice does not explicitly say working overtime for the duration of the project, but it implies so, making this choice an incorrect answer.<br/></p></div></div></div></div><br/>

Since this answer choice addresses the needs of the project manager described in the scenario, it is the best answer to the question asked.<br/>The basis of estimates provides supporting documentation outlining the details used in establishing project estimates such as assumptions, constraints, level of detail, ranges, and confidence levels. However, the question suggests that the Estimate Costs process is being performed and the basis of estimates is an output of this process, and, therefore, is not yet available to be a source of information.<br/>The information required should be readily available in the cost management plan.

At this critical time, the scrum master notices that the performance of one of the team members has dropped, and the team member seems to be communicating less in group discussions. The scrum master should ask the question, what would a true servant leader do in such a situation? The scrum master could respond in many ways. However, there is only one choice that is consistent with the agile mindset, specifically with one of the Agile Manifesto values, that states, ""We value individuals and interactions over process and tools"". The humanistic approach is to have a conversation with the team member privately and in confidence and determine the reason behind the drop in the team member's performance. Understanding what motivates the team member could lead to a potential solution.<br/>This choice is a stopgap measure that may help the team meet the release goal but could cause resentment within the team. Furthermore, it does not address the root of the problem with this specific team member.<br/>Retrospectives typically focus on improving 'team' rather than individual performance. Discussion on individual performance deserves a more confidential approach from an agile leader.<br/>Agile uses leadership instead of management to guide and govern. Leadership is about tapping into people's intrinsic motivations. Agile servant leaders need to know what motivates the members of their team. Therefore, it is reasonable that the scrum master meets with the team member and try to determine what drives this individual.<br/></p></div></div></div></div><br/>

Knowledge management is one of the tailoring considerations associated with cost management and is concerned with the following question, ""Does the organization have a formal knowledge management and financial database repository that a project is required to use and that is readily accessible?"". The question implies that the previous project manager was not updating the financial database repository with the required information. Therefore, among the available choices, knowledge management is the best answer to the question asked.<br/>Project complexity can influence the risk management processes, but it is not the tailoring consideration for the cost management processes as suggested in the question.<br/>The cost management plan is a subsidiary of the project management plan rather than a tailoring consideration.<br/>Earned value management is one of the tailoring considerations associated with the cost management processes.

With agile methodologies, the project team is far more empowered than project teams working in a predictive environment. Agile teams are self-organizing and self-managing but still need servant leadership to empower the team members. With agile projects (phases), the project manager's role as a servant leader will be to facilitate the project team's discovery and definition of agile. Servant leaders approach work in the following order: purpose, people, and then process. You, as the project manager, should first work with the team to define the purpose so they can engage and coalesce around the goal for the project (or phase in this case).<br/>A servant leader on an agile project approaches work in the following order: purpose, people, and then process.

The current total earned value can be obtained by multiplying each activity's planned value by its percentage complete and adding them together. Therefore, the current total earned value is $52,500. The current total planned value is the sum of the planned values of the activities that should have been completed by now according to the approved plan, which is this scenario is $65,000. Note, since the scenario mentions that the method used to determine the earned value is based on percent complete, the earned value of a partially completed work package is calculated by multiplying the planned value of the work package by its the percent complete.<br/>

The calculations are shown below:

SPI = EV / PV

EV = ($5,000 x 100%) + ($10,000 x 100%) + ($50,000 x 75%) = $52,500

PV = $5,000 + $10,000 + $50,000 = $65,000

SPI = $52,500 / $65,000 = 0.81

Therefore, the schedule performance index is 0.81. Additionally, since the SPI is less than one, the project is running behind schedule.<br/>While it is correct that the project is running behind schedule, the first part of this answer choice, -$12,500, represents the schedule variance (SV). However, the question is asking for the schedule performance index and not the schedule variance.<br/>An SPI of 1.0 would indicate that the project is progressing on schedule. However, according to the calculation, the SPI is 0.81, meaning the project is currently running behind schedule. The project manager may believe that the gap will be closed by the end of the project, but that has yet to be seen. The fact that the project manager is confident that the project will be completed on time is not relevant to the actual SPI.<br/> If the SPI were 1.24, the project would have been ahead of schedule. However, this answer choice represents the result of the incorrect usage of the SPI formula where the numerator and denominator are transposed.<br/></p></div></div></div></div><br/>

However, with agile projects, stakeholder influence remains strong throughout the project and does not decrease until the product is released and the project is completed. Agile uses an incremental and iterative approach to product development with regular customer feedback and reviews. This concept is also captured in the Agile Manifesto principle that states, ""Business people and developers must work together daily throughout the project."" Therefore, in this scenario, where the product of the project is developed using an agile framework, the project manager should take into account the fact that stakeholder influence will remain strong throughout the project.<br/>

Once a product is released, the stakeholder influence will be minimized regardless of the project management approach taken.<br/>When a predictive project management framework is utilized, the requirements planning is completed early in the project. Thus, stakeholder influence will be greatest during requirements gathering and then decline.

This practice is sometimes referred to as gold plating, which should not be permitted and needs to be addressed by the project manager. To determine who developed the extra features and then be able to contact the responsible project team member to address the issue, the project manager needs a list of project team members along with their project roles and communication information. The project team directory is a documented list of project team members, their project roles, and communication information. Therefore, of the available choices, reviewing the project team directory is the best answer to the question asked.<br/>

Note, the project team directory is not the same as the project team assignments. The project team directory is a document that lists the project team members, their roles on the project, and contact information (e.g., email address, location, etc.). Project team assignments is a wider document that may contain the project team directory and additional information such as the specific responsibilities of and activities assigned to each team member, as well as their knowledge, skills, and abilities.<br/>

While the scenario mentions an agile project, the project team directory can be used on any project regardless of the project management approach taken. The way the scenario is framed, combined with the answer choices provided, implies that the project is carried out using the hybrid project management approach.<br/>Although the human resources function within an organization typically has the responsibility for record-keeping of employment-related records, it may not maintain records to the level of detail to determine who is developing the data entry screen. The project itself has a document that should contain who was assigned the role of developing the data entry screen.<br/>The team management plan is developed during project planning, before the team is acquired, and may or may not have the requested information. Since during project planning actual team assignments are not yet known (unless the team is pre-assigned), the team management plan is unlikely to contain the information the project manager is looking for. Even if this information exists, there is another answer choice that more accurately addresses the question asked.<br/>The project team directory is a documented list of project team members, their project roles, and communication information. Of the choices provided, reviewing the project team directory is the best course of action for the project manager to find the contact information of the team member who developed the features.<br/></p></div></div></div></div><br/>

However, even when choosing to take a gradual transition, the organization may lack experience and knowledge with agile best practices. One common strategy is to use the services of an external agile coach to help guide the transition and allow the internal personnel to gain exposure and experience with agile methodologies. The external agile coach will have the advantage of experience, but the disadvantage of weak relationships with the client organization. An internal project manager will have established strong relationships but will lack the experience. Thus, supplementing the organization with an external agile coach can help bridge the experience gap and allow the internal project manager time to acquire the necessary skillset.<br/>An experienced agile coach might be helpful in providing the needed servant leadership for the staff. However, this individual will likely have weak relationships with the client organization. The existing project manager, though, has strong relationships, but no agile experience. Providing agile training to the project manager would be a better solution.<br/>The role of a directive project management office (PMO) in organizations is typically to take full control of the projects by directly managing them. The question, however, is asking to find a solution for the transition from one project management approach to another, rather than seeking a way to manage projects undertaken by the organization.<br/>Agile teams are self-forming and self-managing, at least as far as collaborating to complete the project work. However, agile teams still need servant leadership to support the team. Leaving the project team without leadership will not likely be effective.<br/></p></div></div></div></div><br/>

However, when an uncertain or complex element is introduced to a predictive project, that element may add risk. Uncertainty and complexity can be best addressed by agile methods that focus on requirements elaboration, continuous feedback from stakeholders, and short incremental development/delivery cycles. In the scenario described, the majority of the work packages are routine and predictable and have been successfully completed in past projects. However, the solar panels are new and have been never installed before. In this case, you can plan for some small-scale installation trials on the ground first to determine the best installation method and uncover issues early while there is enough time to solve them and incrementally improve processes through experimentation and adaptation. Therefore, the best approach for your project would be predominantly predictive with some agile components, making the overall approach hybrid.<br/>This project management approach can be used on agile projects with an element that is either non-negotiable or not executable using agile methods. One example is the integration of a component developed by a vendor that cannot or is not willing to work incrementally, forcing the component to be integrated upon its delivery.<br/>Since most of the requirements are known upfront, and the project is one of those you have managed in the past, planning the project using predictive methods but then executing the whole project using agile methods just because of one uncertain element (the solar panels) makes little sense.<br/>Most of the project requirements are well known and can be planned in a predictive way. Therefore planning the project using agile would ignore the benefit of having stable plans. On the other hand, executing the project traditionally when one of the components (solar panels) is uncertain, may introduce risks that could have been avoided.<br/></p></div></div></div></div><br/>

It is not mandatory to use a single approach for an entire project. The approach will depend on various factors and should be selected and agreed upon by the relevant stakeholders. The scenario does not specify what exactly was the reason for selecting the hybrid approach. The scenario only states the approach has been selected based on the meetings with the customer, various project stakeholders, project team, and subject matter experts. The scenario suggests that you have several hybrid options on the table and requests you to select the best one of those provided. However, not all answer choices represent hybrid methods. Moreover, none of the incorrect answer choices describes a hybrid project management approach, leaving you with only one option that combines legitimate agile and predictive practices: developing the product using Scrum (agile) and controlling the budget using the cost baseline (predictive).<br/>Scrum is an example of an agile method, in which a single team develops the product of the project. Controlling the budget using the cost baseline is an acceptable approach used on projects carried out with predictive methods. The combination of the two constitutes a hybrid model, making this choice the best answer to the question asked.<br/>Kanban is an example of an agile project management approach. WIP, work in progress, is the number of work items in each column of the Kanban board. The size of the WIP is determined by the team's throughput. Therefore, developing deliverables using Kanban while limiting WIP based on the team's throughput represents the same agile approach to manage the project, making this choice an incorrect answer.<br/>Developing the scope using WBS is typical of a traditional project management approach. Controlling the schedule using the scope baseline does not make any sense. The schedule is typically controlled by the schedule (not scope) baseline. This answer choice is intentionally misleading.<br/></p></div></div></div></div><br/>

The stakeholder engagement plan is a component of the project management plan that identifies the strategies and actions required to promote the productive involvement of stakeholders in project decision making and execution. All of the answer choices represent typical inputs to the Plan Stakeholder Engagement process. However, the question is specifically asking for the 'project documents' that will influence the process underway, and the incorrect answer choices are not considered project documents.<br/>

Note, the Plan Stakeholder Engagement process is typically carried out during project planning. However, as the project progresses, stakeholders may join or leave the project, warranting an additional iteration of the process. Proactive project managers may want to revise the current engagement strategies even when the project is in its execution stage. In such a case, the Plan Stakeholder Engagement process can be performed again, as is likely the case in the scenario described.<br/>The stakeholder register is a project document that provides the list of project stakeholders, including additional classification data and other information. This information is essential while planning stakeholder engagement.<br/>The risk register contains the identified risks of the project and usually links them to the specific stakeholders as either risk owners or as subject to risk impact. Knowing this information may help the project manager in determining what refinements can be made to the plan to improve stakeholder engagement.<br/>The resource management plan is an important project artifact when developing or updating the stakeholder engagement plan. However, the resource management plan is an element of the project management plan rather than a project document.<br/></p></div></div></div></div><br/>

In the reference provided, Alistar Cockburn, one of the Agile Manifesto authors, says that an information radiator ""displays information in a place where passersby can see it. With information radiators, the passerby does not need to ask questions; the information simply hits them as they pass by."" In the scenario provided, an information radiator, such as a Kanban board and/or a burndown chart, can allow the stakeholder to monitor the progress of the user stories being developed by the team. Kanban board can display work in progress at each stage of development. A burndown chart allows seeing how much work remained to be completed in a release or an iteration. Of the choices provided, suggesting that the stakeholder periodically reviews the information radiators would address the stakeholder's request to monitor the status of the team's work on an ongoing basis and is, therefore, the best answer to the question asked.<br/>An iteration review is a meeting where the team demonstrates the product increment developed during the iteration. This meeting provides any stakeholder with the opportunity to review the product and understand the status of the work completed. However, daily standups and iteration retrospectives are typically conducted by the team and intended for the team members only. Stakeholders are not supposed to attend those meetings. Even if they do, the status of work completed is not the main subject discussed there.<br/>Any project, regardless of the project management approach selected, should encourage and be able to provide means to monitor its progress. Stating that agile projects discourage progress monitoring would be misleading<br/> Information radiators are used by agile teams to 'radiate' the status of their progress to the project stakeholders. A review of the information radiators would typically be sufficient for the stakeholders to understand the status of work being performed on a project.<br/></p></div></div></div></div><br/>

The question is specifically asking for examples of the cost of conformance. The cost of conformance includes money spent during the project to avoid failures. Money spent during or after the project as the result of failures would be considered the cost of nonconformance. A cost-benefit analysis should be done as to what quality activities to carry out as part of the project. This analysis will help the relevant stakeholders determine if the planned quality activities are cost-effective. Of the available choices, only warranty claims and lost business would be the result of failures occurring after the product has been delivered to the customer, and these can be eliminated as correct responses. The correct answers are all examples of costs associated with the prevention of failures and are considered costs of conformance.<br/>

Note, no specific knowledge of stamping machines is required to answer this question correctly. All that is needed is the understanding of how the costs of conformance or nonconformance are categorized within the cost of quality. Also, the fact that the machine parts will be produced by vendors does not change the selection of the correct choices.<br/>Warranty claims are an example of costs related to the nonconformance. Within the nonconformance category, costs associated with the warranty claims are considered external failure costs.<br/>Training is an example of prevention costs and would be considered a cost of conformance. Providing relevant training to the project team members may prevent potential mistakes that the team members may make during project execution while producing project deliverables (e.g., while assembling the stamping machine in the scenario described).<br/>Appraisal costs, including testing, would be included among the cost of conformance. In the scenario provided, the machine parts are produced by vendors. Testing the parts prior to assembly would reduce the risk of having malfunctions after the machine is assembled. A cost-benefit analysis can be made as to the costs associated with testing vs. costs of repairing the defects after the machine is assembled.<br/></p></div></div></div></div><br/>

</div></div> </div></div></div><div class='answer'><a class='ans' onclick='showHide(332)'>Ans</a><p style='display:none;' id='ans_332'>1--When a traditional waterfall project management approach is utilized, the project scope is well-defined during initial project planning, and a detailed work breakdown structure (WBS) is developed. A traditional project management approach is effective when the requirements are well understood at the start of the project. However, this situation is not always the case with all projects. In projects with evolving requirements, high risk, or significant uncertainty, the scope is often not understood at the beginning of the project. Agile methods deliberately spend less time trying to define and agree on the scope in the early stage of the project and spend more time establishing the process for its ongoing discovery and refinement. As a result, the project scope evolves throughout the project as the scope is defined and redefined. Therefore, with agile, the project scope will evolve during the project as compared to a traditional project management approach where the project scope is defined upfront.<br/>

<br/>An agile framework may be chosen over a traditional waterfall project management approach when the project scope is not well-understood upfront. Rather the project scope will evolve during the course of the project as it is defined and redefined.<br/>Scope and requirements for agile projects are typically not well-understood upfront. Rather, the project scope is defined and redefined throughout the project. Thus, an agile project will not have a detailed work breakdown structure (WBS) created during initial project planning.<br/>Unlike in traditional project management, with an agile project, change is welcomed rather than avoided and controlled. Projects where the project scope is not well understood at the start of the project typically utilize an agile framework where the project scope evolves throughout the project. A strict change management system would be detrimental to an agile project and contrary to agile best practices.<br/></p></div></div></div></div><br/>

To accelerate the sharing of information among stakeholders, agile methods promote aggressive transparency. The intent of inviting any stakeholders (which would include the client) to project meetings and reviews is to surface as quickly as possible any misalignment, dependency, or other issue related to the changing project. On agile projects, often the client, user, and the development team exchange information in a dynamic co-creative process that leads to more stakeholder involvement and higher satisfaction.

This method is used to estimate the minimum project duration and determine the amount of schedule flexibility on the logical network paths within the schedule model. The critical path method is typically applicable for projects that are lead using the predictive project management approach. On such projects, the deliverables are completed during project execution, validated and accepted towards the end of the project, and handed over to the customer (or operations, or dedicated stakeholders) during project closure.<br/>

The scenario, however, describes a situation in which the sponsor is not willing to wait till the end of the project and prefers to have the deliverables as they are completed. The scenario also indicates that the deliverables (catalogs) are similar in size and scope. Under such circumstances, the project manager can take a hybrid project management approach that combines traditional methods to manage scope and cost (as indicated by the scope and cost baselines in the scenario provided) and on-demand scheduling, which is typically used on agile projects, specifically in a Kanban system. On-demand scheduling and, similarly, pull-based scheduling, does not rely on a schedule that was prepared previously for the development of the product but rather pulls work from a backlog or intermediate queue to be done as resources become available. Similarly, iterative scheduling, which is also used on agile projects, may likewise support the sponsor's request to deliver the catalogs incrementally as they are completed. The only scheduling approach which would not allow continuous delivery of value is the critical path, let alone a critical path is not even a scheduling approach as requested by the question, but rather a method. Therefore, of the choices provided, the project manager should avoid the critical path method.<br/>Iterative scheduling is used on agile projects where the scope is broken down into user stories that are prioritized and scheduled for development in time-boxed iterations. Each iteration can result in the completion of several catalogs, thus meeting the sponsor's request. Therefore, avoiding Iterative scheduling would not be a wise choice.<br/>On-demand scheduling allows for the deliverables (catalogs) to be completed one-by-one as they go through the task (e.g., Kanban) board. One catalog can be in the design column, another one in development, one more in testing, and so on. The catalogs are delivered as they are completed, which is what the sponsor requested. Therefore, on-demand scheduling should not be avoided.<br/>Critical path is a method that is typically used in traditional projects to display the sequence of activities that represents the longest path through the project, which determines the shortest possible duration. Using this method will likely result in all the catalogs to be completed and then delivered in bulk, which is what the sponsor is trying to avoid, making this choice the best answer to the question asked.<br/></p></div></div></div></div><br/>

In the scenario, the team has created a minimal viable product (MVP) that is ready for release. One of the objectives of agile methodologies is to deliver value incrementally so that project benefits can be realized as soon as possible rather than waiting until the end of the project. The fact that the quality assurance department lacks policies and procedures for interim deliverables represents an organizational impediment. One of the responsibilities of the project manager as a servant leader is to address and remove impediments, obstacles, and blockers for the team so that the team can deliver the most value to the organization. In this case, the project manager should collaborate with the quality assurance department to revise the policies and procedures to permit the delivery of the MVP. If those efforts fail, then the next logical step would be to escalate the issue to the project sponsor. Since working directly with the quality assurance department to resolve the issue was not offered as an answer choice, the best answer, of the choices provided, is to escalate the issue to the project sponsor to remove the organizational impediment.<br/>

Note, the term 'impediment board' is used in the Agile Practice Guide as specified in the reference.<br/>Quality control measurements are the documented results of the activities carried out as part of the Control Quality process.

Adaptive planning defines a plan but acknowledges that once work starts, the priorities may change and that the plan may need to be updated. One of the trends and emerging practices for Project Schedule Management includes iterative scheduling with a backlog. Iterative scheduling is a form of rolling wave planning based on adaptive life cycles, such as the agile approach for product development. The requirements are documented in user stories that are then prioritized and refined just prior to construction, and the product features are developed using time-boxed periods of work. The benefit of this approach is that it welcomes changes throughout the development life cycle and may reduce or eliminate the need for a formal change control process, making iterative scheduling with a backlog the best answer to the question asked. Such a combination indicates that the project, as a whole, would have been managed using a hybrid project management approach.<br/> Iterative scheduling is a form of rolling wave planning based on adaptive life cycles, such as the agile approach for product development.

Options are alternative courses of action that may be taken by the organization. Doing less than the minimum work possible to address the problem makes the least sense from a business perspective. Taking this option means that the company would expend company resources without receiving the benefits of the project.

This option is also referred to as the ""business as usual"" option.

Therefore, conflict management is one of the most important interpersonal and team skills that project managers have to master. The success of project managers in managing their project teams often depends on their ability to resolve conflict. In the scenario described, the conflict is between the project manager and the team. The conflict is at the level that negatively impacts the team's morale and jeopardizes the project's goals. However, selecting the appropriate conflict resolution technique depends on the project manager and the circumstances surrounding the conflict. Under different circumstances, different project managers may use different conflict resolution methods. Factors that influence these methods include the importance and intensity of the conflict, time pressure for resolving the conflict, relative power of the people involved in the conflict, importance of maintaining a good relationship, motivation to resolve conflict on a long-term or short-term basis, etc.<br/>

There are five general techniques for resolving conflict: withdrawal/avoiding, smoothing/accommodating, compromising/reconciling, forcing/directing, collaborating/problem-solving. In the scenario, the project manager decides to smooth the conflict. There is not enough information in the scenario to determine whether the project manager's decision was right or wrong. However, this information is not required to answer the question correctly. All that is needed to select the correct answer is to understand the various degrees of desire to satisfy the concerns of the parties involved in the conflict and map the desire to the technique described in the scenario, keeping in mind that the scenario is presented from the project manager's perspective.<br/>Area A represents a low desire to satisfy team members' concerns but a high desire to satisfy the project manager's own concerns. From the project manager's perspective, this would be a force/direct technique, in which the project manager would push his/her viewpoint at the expense of the team, offering a win-lose solution. In the scenario described, the project manager decides to smooth the conflict, making this choice an incorrect answer.<br/>Area B represents a high desire to satisfy team members' concerns as well as a high desire to satisfy the project manager's own concerns. From the project manager's perspective, this would be a collaborate/problem-solve technique, in which multiple viewpoints and insights from different perspectives are incorporated. This approach typically results in a win-win situation. In the scenario described, the project manager decides to smooth the conflict, making this choice an incorrect answer.<br/>Area C represents a low desire to satisfy team members' concerns as well as a low desire to satisfy the project manager's own concerns. From the project manager's perspective, this would be an avoid/withdraw technique, in which parties retreat from an actual or potential conflict situation, postponing the issue to be better prepared or to be resolved by others. In the scenario described, the project manager decides to smooth the conflict, making this choice an incorrect answer.<br/></p></div></div></div></div><br/>

Without an approved charter the scope and nature of the project may not be clearly defined, or the project could progress in a direction that is not in alignment with the organization's objectives. The act of creating an approved charter shows management support for the project and the project manager. If the project starts without the project charter, the project may suffer from the lack of resources throughout its entire life cycle. The lack of resources is likely to lead to project failure which will likely be perceived as the project manager's fault. A better answer choice would be “refuse to proceed with the project and explain the impact of proceeding without an approved charter.” However, this option is not given. Therefore, of those provided, refusing to begin the project is the best answer to the question asked.<br/>Beginning the project without a charter can lead to later issues since the primary purpose of the charter is to formally authorize the project and most importantly, to provide the project manager with the authority to apply organizational resources to project activities. Documenting the lack of the project charter in the risk register will not resolve the central issue described in the scenario. Therefore, starting the project without a charter is not the best answer.<br/>This response is an avoidance tactic, which is typically not an advisable way to handle problems, especially when the chances of project success are at stake.<br/>The project manager and the project team use the project charter as a starting point for initial project planning; therefore, the project charter is an input to the Develop Project Management Plan process. Since the charter is not approved, the project manager doesn't know if the information he included in the charter was accurate. It would be counterproductive to start the development of the project management plan with information that may be incorrect or incomplete. Additionally, beginning the development of the project management plan would constitute starting the project, which is not formally authorized without the approved project charter.<br/></p></div></div></div></div><br/>

This does not mean, however, that no documentation should be created on an agile project at all. Reasonable documentation is still required. For example, customers may need user manuals, teams need requirement documents, and the project and the organization may still require project management plans and project schedules. Creating this documentation requires an effort from the agile team. Therefore, the team should account for this work and add it to the product backlog as documentation user stories.<br/> Legally required documents must be completed as required by law.

A typical burndown chart tracks the number of story points completed in an iteration or a release. In this scenario, during the iteration retrospective meeting, the project manager and team are analyzing the burndown chart of the recently completed iteration. The goal of the iteration retrospective is to reflect on the work performed and improve the process going forward. Burndown charts can help analyze the team's velocity. Identifying gaps in velocity and finding the reason for being unable to meet the iteration goal may provide insight into what could be improved. For example, when the actual velocity is equal to the planned one, the curve of the story points remaining to be completed overlaps the curve of the planned work. When the velocity is slower than planned, the curves diverge. When the team completes work faster than planned, the slope of the curve of the remaining work is steeper than the planned curve.<br/>

According to the iteration burndown chart presented in the scenario, right off the start, during the first 2.5 days, the curve of the story points remained to be completed was diverging from the plan, meaning the team's velocity was lower than the one needed to complete the work planned for those days. From the middle of day 3 till the middle of day 5, for whatever reason, the team completed no story points at all. As the iteration progressed, the team's velocity varied and the number of the story points remaining to be completed went down. However, at some point during that period (on day 7), the gap between planned and actual work was at its maximum value of nearly 15 story points, significantly diverging from the plan. Although towards the end of the iteration the team members were able to catch up a bit, yet they failed to close the gap entirely, thus missing the iteration goal.<br/>

Note, no calculation is required to answer this question. All is needed, is a simple visual analysis of the burndown chart.<br/>Area A represents approximately the first 2.5 days of the 10-day iteration. At the beginning of the first day, the number of story points planned is the largest and equal to the number of story points remaining to be completed. Therefore, the number of story points actually completed is zero. By the end of the period represented by area A, the team has completed approximately 5 story points, while it should have completed about 8. However, this gap is still the smallest of those the team accumulated during any other periods throughout the iteration.<br/>Area B represents approximately the next 2 days of the iteration. The exact number of days in this area is not important. What important is that the curve of the story points remaining to be completed is flat, meaning the team did not complete any work at all. Finding the reason for why this occurred may help the team improve the process going forward.<br/>Area C represents the longest period of the iteration, approximately 4 days. During this period, the team accumulated the largest gap between the planned and actual work. For example, one can see that on days 7 and 8, the gap was around 15 story points. During this period, however, the team has completed the largest amount of work, between 15 to 20 story points.<br/></p></div></div></div></div><br/>

The product design and development are characterized by high uncertainty and unclear requirements, whereas the regulatory approval process is well-known upfront with clearly defined requirements. In this situation, agile methodologies will be better suited for product development, and a predictive model will be more appropriate for the regulatory approval process. Combining agile and predictive project management frameworks in a single project will result in a hybrid approach. Crystal represents a family of agile methodologies. Crystal red is appropriate for large projects (or phases) that are characterized as life-critical. Therefore, as it applies to the management of threats to compliance, the best option of the available choices is to select Crystal red for product development and manage the regulatory approval process with a traditional predictive approach.<br/>An agile approach would be more appropriate for product development that is characterized by a high degree of uncertainty. The process of gaining regulatory approval, however, would benefit from a traditional predictive project management approach that better fits predefined, highly structured processes like the one described in the scenario.<br/>A traditional waterfall model might be a good approach for regulatory approval since the requirements can be well-defined upfront. However, Crystal orange would not be appropriate for a project involving more than 40 people. Additionally, the question describes a life-critical product, for which Crystal red would be a better choice.<br/>A predictive model might be a good choice for regulatory approval.

The scenario suggests that the project manager is now starting the Identify Stakeholders process to create the stakeholder register. The stakeholder register will eventually contain information on the roles of stakeholders on the project which is the information the project manager is looking for. However, the stakeholder register is not yet ready. The project charter is an input to the Identify Stakeholders process and has the high-level information about the roles and responsibilities of the key project stakeholders. This information will be used in the development of the stakeholder register. Hence, to find information on the responsibilities of stakeholders, reviewing the project charter is what the project manager should do, and is, therefore, the best answer to the question asked.<br/>The stakeholder engagement plan identifies the strategies and actions required to promote the productive involvement of stakeholders in project decision making and execution. The plan does not have information on the responsibilities of stakeholders. Even if it did, the question suggests that the project manager is just starting the process of creating the stakeholder register. Therefore, the stakeholder engagement plan is not yet available.<br/> While meeting with the stakeholders may provide the project manager with the information she is looking for, meeting with the stakeholders is unlikely to be the best use of the project manager's and the stakeholders' time. Another answer choice represents a better and more effective course of action.<br/>The project sponsor may or may not have the knowledge of the responsibilities of project stakeholders. Consulting with the project sponsor is not the best choice when other options, such as reviewing the project charter, are readily available for the project manager.<br/>

Agile teams are self-organizing, self-managing, and empowered to make decisions related to their work. When team performance slows down, the team can apply various collaboration techniques (such as pairing, swarming, and mobbing) to get back on track. These techniques are aimed to quickly produce a small number of features across the Kanban board, thus expediting the work and increasing the overall throughput. Collaboration is possible thanks to the fact that the team members are generalizing specialists, which means they have both a specialty plus a breadth of experience across multiple skills, rather than a single specialization. Agile team members work to develop such characteristics due to intense collaboration and self-organization that allow them to pair, swarm, and mob, eventually getting work done quickly and efficiently. Reducing WIP limits, as suggested by the agile coach in the scenario, encourages pairing, swarming, and mobbing to resolve problems and expedite work. Of the choices provided, pairing, swarming, and mobbing are valid terms that represent collaboration techniques. While jamming is a legitimate word used in various connotations, the term ""jamming"" is not associated with agile project management. Since the question is asking to select the 'least' likely approach to implement the agile coach's suggestion to collaborate, jamming is the best answer.<br/>In software development, pairing refers to pair programming, an agile technique in which two team members develop software code together as a pair. Since pairing is an example of a collaborative technique, and the question is looking for the 'least' collaborative approach, this choice can be eliminated.<br/>Swarming is an example of a collaboration technique in which multiple team members focus collectively on resolving a specific task, issue, impediment, etc. The question is asking for the 'least' likely collaborative approach. Since swarming is an example of collaboration, this choice represents an incorrect answer.<br/>While jamming is a legitimate word used in various connotations, the term ""jamming"" is not associated with agile project management. As far as project management is concerned, ""jamming"" is a made-up term. Since the question is requesting to select the 'least' likely collaborative approach, this choice is considered the correct answer.<br/></p></div></div></div></div><br/>

Quality roles and responsibilities are some of the components of this plan. The way a project addresses quality management depends on the project management approach selected for the project. In traditional projects, quality management is often the responsibility of specific team members and is typically done at the end of the project when the deliverables are completed. In agile projects, quality management is performed by all team members throughout the project. While the scenario does not specifically mention what project management approach has been selected for this project, the fact the project manager is developing the quality management plan implies the project is likely traditional than agile. Even if this assumption is wrong, the decision the project manager makes with regard to the way quality will be managed on the project (by all team members throughout the project) implies an agile approach has been incorporated into the project. And since there is only one answer choice that reflects this conclusion, incorporating agile quality management practices into a traditionally lead project is the best answer to the question asked.<br/> In traditional projects, quality management is often the responsibility of specific team members and is typically done at the end of the project. In the scenario, the project manager decides that quality management will be performed by all team members throughout the project, making this choice an incorrect answer.<br/>The project manager has the ultimate responsibility for the project outcomes, including the quality of the deliverables. It does not seem in the scenario that the project manager is trying to avoid responsibility. All the project manager is doing is changing the approach of how, when, and by whom quality activities are performed.<br/>Determining the areas of strengths and weaknesses of the team members is an activity associated with the individual and team assessments that can be performed as part of the Develop Team process. In the scenario, the project manager is developing a quality management plan rather than trying to assess the team members.<br/></p></div></div></div></div><br/>

</div></div> </div></div></div><div class='answer'><a class='ans' onclick='showHide(360)'>Ans</a><p style='display:none;' id='ans_360'>3--The scenario indicates that the project is transitioning from a waterfall model to agile with an emphasis on eXtreme Programming (XP). With a predictive approach, tasks associated with the Control Quality process are typically assigned to specific team members and performed at specified times throughout the project or phase. When an agile approach is used, the Control Quality activities may be performed by any or all of the project team members throughout the project lifecycle. For example, one of the tenents of XP includes the concept of collective code ownership, which means that the entire team is responsible for the code and any team member can modify the code as needed regardless of who wrote it. Therefore, in this scenario, the responsibility for controlling quality will likely transition from specified team members to the entire development team.<br/>

It is worth noting that just because the entire team is responsible for controlling quality when using an agile framework, this does not mean to suggest that all quality assurance tasks will be performed by every member of the team. Obviously, specific individuals might accept ownership of certain tasks, but anyone can perform the tasks and the responsibility resides with the entire team regardless of who actually performs the tasks.<br/>With agile frameworks, quality control typically becomes the responsibility of the entire project team rather than assigned to specified individuals as this typically is done when a predictive project management approach is used.<br/>This answer choice reflects quality processes that are typically associated with the predictive project management approach. When using agile methodologies, quality is controlled throughout the project rather than at specified times.<br/>Various project management methodologies require different approaches for controlling quality. Since the project is transitioning from a waterfall model to agile, it is reasonable to assume that the entire development team will assume responsibility for controlling quality.<br/></p></div></div></div></div><br/>
