</div></div> </div></div></div><div class='answer'><a class='ans' onclick='showHide(361)'>Ans</a><p style='display:none;' id='ans_361'>3--It seems as if the sponsor does not completely understand how project status is reported on agile projects. Project status reports are typically used on projects that are carried out using the predictive (traditional/waterfall) project management approach. Agile projects, however, like the one described in the scenario, use different tools and technics to share project progress with the stakeholders. Information radiators are the most commonly used tools to address the reporting need. However, this answer choice is not provided. Another way to apprise stakeholders of the value gain process is to demonstrate the product increment developed during a sprint at the sprint review meeting. The scrum master's task in this situation is to educate the sponsor about agile best practices. One of them is to have the stakeholders attend the sprint review meeting where they can see in their own eyes the product increment built by the team. Therefore, of the choices provided, inviting the sponsor to the sprint review meeting is the best course of action for the scrum master.<br/>ogress, the main goal of the meeting is to plan, not to share the project progress with the stakeholders.<br/> The daily standup is a brief collaborative meeting in which the team members review progress from the previous day, declare intentions for the current day, and highlights any obstacles encountered or anticipated. This meeting would not provide the sponsor with information regarding the overall project and its progress.<br/>The sprint review meeting is a meeting in which the development team demonstrates the product increment developed during the sprint to the customer, product owner, as well as any other interested stakeholders. By attending this event, the sponsor, in their own eyes, will be able to see the working product increment and make conclusions as to how well the project progresses.<br/></p></div></div></div></div><br/>

The project schedule identifies the start and end dates of project activities, including procurement activities. It also defines when contractor deliverables are due. Of the available choices, only the project schedule provides both the planned start and finish dates of project activities, for example, drywall installation and walls painting.<br/>Terms of reference (TOR) is the phrase that sometimes used when contracting for services. TOR may include elements, such as tasks of the contractor, standards the contractor will have to adhere to, list of services to be provided, etc. The definition of the schedule for initial submission can be included in the TOR. However, the final dates are specified in the project schedule, not in TOR.<br/>The resource breakdown structure is a project document that hierarchically represents resources by their category and type. The resource breakdown structure may include details such as labor, material, equipment, supplies, skill level, required certifications, etc. However, this project document does not specify the dates a resource (either human or physical) would be applied to a project activity.<br/>The project schedule identifies the start and end dates of project activities, including procurement activities.

A prioritized backlog helps guide the development team to build the highest value features first, so the customer can start realizing the greatest value as early as possible. With agile project management, specifically Scrum, the product owner serves as the voice of the customer and is responsible for prioritizing the product backlog. In this scenario, the newly assigned product owner is not likely to have the knowledge to effectively perform their role since the product owner role does not typically exist within a predictive environment. The project manager should ensure that the product owner is adequately trained to perform their role effectively.<br/>Story points are used to estimate the items in the product backlog, not to prioritize them. Items in the backlog are prioritized based on their value to the customer. The prioritization is the ultimate responsibility of a product owner, assuming one is assigned to the project.<br/>The MoSCoW method is a prioritization technique that might be useful in prioritizing the product backlog to ensure the most valuable features are developed first. However, it is the product owner, not the development team, that is ultimately responsible for prioritizing the product backlog.<br/>The product owner is ultimately responsible for prioritizing the product backlog to ensure that the most valuable features are delivered first. Therefore, it will be critical that the product owner has the appropriate training to perform their role effectively.

Agile development is typically performed by self-organizing self-managing teams of generalizing specialists. However, being self-organizing and self-managing does not necessarily mean the team members will be able to self-educate themselves on the missing knowledge. Even if they can, the time they will spend acquiring new knowledge and skills will likely be less productive, and the team members will have to be paid while they are learning. Therefore, the time spend by the team studying the new material should be accounted for in the project budget.<br/>

However, none of the answer choices suggests otherwise and, therefore, selecting the correct answer should be done with the assumption in mind that some knowledge is missing.<br/>Regardless of whether or not the team members will be able to acquire the missing knowledge, the time spent for the learning as well as training costs in case the training is delivered by a consultant (whether internal or external) should be accounted for in the project budget, making this choice the best answer to the question asked.<br/>Being self-organizing and self-managing typically refers to the team's ability to make decisions related to their work. However, this does not necessarily mean the team members will be able to self-educate themselves on the missing knowledge.

A deliverable unit should be defined between the buyer and seller and can represent a function, story point, micro-deliverable, user story, etc. This type of contract is useful when the scope of the work is likely to change frequently, like in the scenario described. In the fixed-price microdeliverables contract type, the buyer and seller agree on a specific price to be paid for each unit delivered. Thus, regardless of the changes in scope, a fair and contracted fee can be determined and paid to the seller.<br/>

One may argue that since the seller will be required to develop the application using agile methods, and since the Agile Manifesto values customer collaboration over contract negotiation, no contracts will be required. However, the way the scenario is worded, ""As part of the Conduct Procurements process..."", suggests that the project has both elements, predictive and agile, making the whole project hybrid and warranting to have a contract in place.<br/>Fixed-price, fixed-scope contracts make sense when the requirements are stable, which is not the case described in the scenario<br/>Fixed-price microdeliverables is a contract in which the scope can be decomposed into small independent increments, such as user stories. Each user story is estimated in story points and represents a working product functionality. The buyer and the seller agree on a deliverable unit, such as a story point. Once a user story is delivered, its price is determined based on the amount of the story points contained in the user story, so that the buyer pays the seller for only those story points delivered.<br/>Not to exceed' means that a ceiling is imposed on the total amount paid to the seller, which protects the buyer in case the work goes slower than expected. 'Fixed fee' means that the seller is guaranteed a certain profit margin over their materials and subcontractors’ fees. The main reason for this choice to be an incorrect answer is that the not-to-exceed with fixed-fee contract presupposes stable requirements, which is not the case in the scenario described.<br/></p></div></div></div></div><br/>

You have five strategies to consider for dealing with specific opportunities: escalate, exploit, share, enhance, and accept. Considering that your organization has just acquired a new subsidiary, you should exploit opportunities to capture the benefits of assimilating them into the organization. Using new technologies to reduce cost and duration are a key example of exploiting an opportunity.<br/>

When it comes to overall project risk, there is a similar set of five strategies to consider: avoid, exploit, transfer/share, mitigate/enhance, and accept. Where the level of overall project risk is significantly positive and outside the agreed-upon risk thresholds for the project, an exploit strategy may be adopted. An example of exploiting at the overall project level would include the addition of high-benefit elements of scope to the project to add value or benefits to stakeholders. Alternatively, to embrace the opportunity, the risk thresholds for the project may be modified if the key stakeholders are in agreement.<br/>

Note, the risk thresholds are recorded in the risk management plan to reflect the acceptable level of overall project risk exposure. Since the risk management plan is a component of the project management plan, a change request is required to modify any information included in the plan, such as the risk thresholds.<br/> Doing nothing when there is a clear opportunity from which the project can benefit (even if the opportunity does not meet the existing risk thresholds) is unlikely to be the best course of action and is not what a project manager is expected to do.<br/>A change that affects technological resources, staff skills, schedules and costs would normally require more formality than just asking your sponsor for permission.<br/>The new subsidiary has a new set of stakeholders with different risk appetite. To embrace the opportunity, the risk thresholds for the project may be modified if the key stakeholders are in agreement. A change request should also address the requisite adjustments to cost and schedule baselines.<br/></p></div></div></div></div><br/>

Participatory decision making is a creative process that delegates decision ownership to the entire team. There are a variety of methods that are employed to help facilitate the finding of a choice that is acceptable to the team. In an agile environment, the purpose of participatory decision making is to supply the project team with specific practices to make and analyze the countless decisions that arise during the project. The team members need to be encouraged and enabled to collaborate and readily make decisions due to the short timeboxes that are inherent in agile projects. This practice would also allow the team to minimize or even prevent costly decision-making delays.<br/>A cross-functional team consists of individuals who are willing to explore other areas of expertise with which they currently may not be familiar in order to increase the overall efficiency and productivity of the team as a whole. An example of cross-functional training would be to have a developer cross-trained on how to run an integrated testing program. Although their primary expertise is in the area of development, they are willing to expand their knowledge of testing to improve the team's capabilities.<br/>Self-organization of an agile project team occurs when the majority of the tasks performed by the team members have been selected, organized, and executed by them, rather than being dictated by someone else. Members of self-organizing teams are much more motivated when they understand that their input is welcomed and valued. Although participatory decision-making benefits from a team's ability to self-organize, self-organization is not the best answer to this question.<br/>In participatory decision making, the team members participate in the decision process, and the decision is made by a preponderance of the vote. While the process of participatory decision making can be contentious, it is based on mutual trust and respect.<br/></p></div></div></div></div><br/>

This concept is known as team empowerment, which is a fundamental aspect of servant leadership. Lean thinking includes the ability to delegate work while still retaining responsibility for the outcomes. Retaining the responsibility can be accomplished using visual controls, where a manager can see the team's process, see how the team is doing at any time, and see the team's outcomes. If the team members get into trouble, the manager can actively coach them to improve their results without telling them specifically what to do.<br/>Eliminating waste in lean refers to reducing work in progress, decreasing partially done work, eliminating delays, and focusing on building the right features. Delegating work to the team and encouraging them to make local decisions as described in the scenario covers a different lean concept.<br/>The idea behind fast failure, as it pertains to lean-agile project management, is that if the project is doomed to fail, it's better to happen earlier than later to minimize the waste of resources. While delegating duties to the team members and allowing them to make local decisions may result in a failure, the failure is not the goal here. It's a possible (and unwanted) outcome. The goal is team empowerment.<br/>Agile teams are known to be self-organizing, self-directing, and empowered to make decisions related to their work. Delegating some of the duties to the team lead as well as encouraging the team members to make local decisions supports the concept of team empowerment, making this choice the best answer to the question asked.<br/></p></div></div></div></div><br/>

Additionally, the employees will require training, not only in agile best practices but also to become generalizing specialists to better support agility. This type of transformation will not happen overnight, and attempting to do so will likely result in the failure of the transition. A more appropriate approach would be to begin introducing agile practices gradually within the existing predictive model. Over time, projects can include more agile elements and less predictive until the organization can adopt agile exclusively. When agile practices are incorporated into a predictive model, the project becomes a hybrid framework.<br/>A large and complex organization will likely require a gradual approach to transition from predictive to agile methodologies. Incorporating elements of agile within the existing predictive framework will allow for the gradual adoption and acceptance of agile methods.<br/>A large organization that is steeped in the predictive model may have great difficulty in transitioning to agile methodologies, particularly if the organization is siloed, and the employees are specialized contributors. It would be more appropriate to establish a gradual transformation rather than attempt to convert the organization from waterfall to agile overnight.

Therefore, this project is a hybrid project that includes elements of predictive and agile frameworks. Dynamic Systems Development Method (DSDM) is known for the constraint-driven delivery approach. With constraint-driven delivery, the budget and release date would be fixed, whereas the scope is variable. With the project team's velocity exceeding expectations, the team should be able to deliver more features to be included in the release, but the release date should not be changed.<br/>

Additionally, since the project has an approved project management plan, it is reasonable to assume that the release date is incorporated into the schedule baseline, which is part of the project management plan. An approved change request would be required to update the schedule baseline. Change requests are handled in accordance with the change management plan. There is not enough information in the scenario to determine if the project manager alone has the authority to approve change requests. Therefore, adjusting the release date is the 'least' likely decision to be delegated to the project team.<br/>With constraint-driven delivery, the budget and release date would be fixed, whereas the scope is variable. If velocity is higher than planned, then the project team should be able to deliver more features for inclusion in the release rather than moving up the release date.<br/>The project schedule is a project document, and, unlike the schedule baseline, does not require an approved change request to be updated. Although the project schedule is typically maintained by the project manager, it is possible for the project manager to delegate this responsibility to project team members.<br/>When using constraint-driven delivery, the time and cost are fixed, whereas the scope is variable.

</div></div> </div></div></div><div class='answer'><a class='ans' onclick='showHide(377)'>Ans</a><p style='display:none;' id='ans_377'>3--The process of change management is fundamentally different in projects where requirements are not defined upfront warranting the use of agile methodologies to develop the product. With a waterfall approach, the requirements are typically defined upfront and, therefore, scope changes are discouraged. For such projects, a rigorous change management process is in place to ensure that change is minimized, and only the most important changes are incorporated into the project. Agile takes a different approach to change management. To provide the best value for the client, in projects where deliverables are produced using agile practices, change is anticipated and welcomed. Instead of relying on a formal process for managing change, the product owner, which is a role responsible for managing customer requirements (backlog items), is much more involved in the planning of each iteration by providing a prioritized backlog of features for the development team to produce. A change management plan, if it is used at all, will be of little value for an agile project compared with a project using a traditional waterfall approach. The scenario presents a hybrid project where most of the project aspects are managed using the traditional project management approach, while the development of the product is carried out using agile. Agile has been selected because the requirements were not defined upfront. Therefore, of the available choices, the project team will likely spend less time developing and/or implementing the change management plan so that the frequent changes required by the customer will be easier accommodated.<br/>The project charter is a document issued by the project initiator or sponsor that formally authorizes the existence of a project and provides the project manager with the authority to apply organizational resources to project activities. The complexity of the project charter (and thus the time spent in development) is more closely related to the size and importance of the project rather than the methodology that will be used. The project charter is not fundamentally different in an agile project compared to a hybrid or traditional waterfall project.<br/>The issue log is a project document where information about issues is recorded and monitored. Issues will occur on projects regardless of the methodology that is being used. It is equally important for issues to be addressed on agile projects as it is for projects using a hybrid or waterfall approach. Therefore, there is not likely to be a significant difference in the time spent developing and implementing the issue log.<br/>The change management plan is the component of the project management plan that establishes the change control board, documents the extent of its authority, and describes how the change control system will be implemented. Projects in which deliverables are build using agile practices do not typically use a change control board or have formal procedures for processing change requests. Changes are made at the discretion of the product owner rather than being controlled through a formal change management process.<br/></p></div></div></div></div><br/>

</div></div> </div></div></div><div class='answer'><a class='ans' onclick='showHide(378)'>Ans</a><p style='display:none;' id='ans_378'>2--The schedule variance (SV) can be calculated as the earned value (EV) minus the planned value (PV). The current total earned value can be obtained by multiplying each activity's planned value by its percentage complete and adding them together. Therefore, the current total earned value is $52,500. The current total planned value is the sum of the planned values of the activities that should have been completed according to the approved plan, which is this scenario is $65,000. Note, since the scenario mentions that the method used to determine the earned value is based on percent complete, the earned value of a partially completed work package is calculated by multiplying the planned value of the work package by its percent complete.<br/>

The following are the correct calculations for the schedule variance:

SV = EV - PV

EV = ($5,000 x 100%) + ($10,000 x 100%) + ($50,000 x 75%) = $52,500

PV = $5,000 + $10,000 + $50,000 = $65,000

SV = $52,500 - $65,000 = -$12,500

Therefore, the schedule variance (SV) is -$12,500. Since the SV is a negative value, in this case, the project is running behind schedule.<br/>While the schedule variance is indeed -$12,500, the project performance 'can' be determined using various earned value measurement techniques. For example, when the schedule variance is negative, such as in this scenario, the project is behind schedule.<br/>The schedule variance (SV) can be calculated as the earned value (EV) minus the planned value (PV) or SV = EV - PV. The EV is calculated as EV = ($5,000 x 100%) + ($10,000 x 100%) + ($50,000 x 75%) = $52,500. The PV is calculated as PV = $5,000 + $10,000 + $50,000 = $65,000. Therefore, SV = $52,500 - $65,000 = -$12,500. Since the SV is a negative value, the project is running behind schedule.<br/>The schedule variance is -$12,500. Negative schedule variance means the project is behind, not ahead of, schedule.<br/></p></div></div></div></div><br/>

This is evident from the fact that the project manager submits a change request to modify stakeholder engagement guidelines specified in the project management plan (likely in the stakeholder engagement plan). Incorporating agile practices into a traditionally managed project would result in a hybrid project. One of the agile practices is engaging with stakeholders directly rather than going through layers of management. While it is unclear from the scenario what exactly was the main source of stakeholder dissatisfaction, from the choices provided, only engaging with stakeholders directly is an agile practice related to stakeholder engagement and is, therefore, the best answer to the question asked.<br/>Shielding the team from interruptions is one of the servant leader's duties, which is typical for projects that use an agile project management approach. However, it is unclear if this action would improve the way stakeholders are engaged, which is the problem presented by the scenario.<br/> Replacing the WBS with a product backlog indeed represents the incorporation of agile practice. However, this action would only change the way the requirements on the project are documented and managed. It is unclear if stakeholder satisfaction from how they are engaged in the project would improve as a result of this replacement.<br/>One of the agile principles states that face-to-face communication is the most efficient method of conveying information. Stakeholder engagement and communications are closely related and depend on one another. Engaging with stakeholders directly reflects this principle and, therefore, would hopefully improve stakeholder satisfaction.<br/></p></div></div></div></div><br/>

If it is determined that the project is behind schedule, a decision has to be made as to what are the next steps to bring the project in line with the plan. According to the Agile Manifesto principle #8, agile processes promote sustainable development. Working overtime may cause team members to become frustrated, lead to reduced productivity, and eventually get burnt out. On occasions, for short periods, teams may be required to work extra hours. However, in order to understand whether such an effort is required in this situation, other available alternatives should be considered first. According to the scenario, reducing project scope is an option. However, since the product development is carried out using agile practices, the product owner should be consulted. Crashing is a schedule compression technique used to shorten the schedule duration. Working overtime or adding resources are examples of crashing.<br/>An iteration retrospective is held after the iteration is over. According to the scenario, the current iteration is the last one for the project. Therefore, waiting for the issue to be discussed at the retrospective of the last iteration would be too late.<br/>On agile projects, or on projects where the scope is developed using agile practices, as implied by the scenario, the product owner is responsible for the scope (product backlog). The project manager has to meet the product owner and decide on whether to remove some work packages (user stories) from the WBS (backlog) and complete the work with the existing resources or crash the schedule to complete all originally planned work without reducing scope.<br/>Eventually, the root cause for the dealy will have to be determined so that the knowledge gained will be used to improve the future performance of the team.

Co-location would also allow the team members to use highly effective agile high-touch/low-tech tools. However, setting up a fully co-located team is not always possible. In many cases, some of the team members would likely work remotely. In such situations, project managers aspiring to promote agile best practices should find creative ways to use substitute tools to mimic a co-located environment. While none of the answer choices provided in the question has a complete set of all tools available for the agile teams to communicate and collaborate efficiently, one choice has a combination of high-touch/low-tech tools (whiteboards, index cards, sticky notes) and low-touch/high-tech tools (web cameras, microphones). The first set would help the co-located team members to communicate among themselves, while the second set may help the co-located team members communicate with their remote peers.<br/>The items described in this answer choice would only meet the needs of the co-located team members. However, these tools would not support the collaboration between the collocated portion of the team and those working remotely in the different time zones.<br/>Instant messaging applications, web cameras, microphones would enable communication between the co-located and remote team members since these tools are mainly designed to bridge the gap for teams where not everyone is collocated. Agile promotes the use of high-touch/low-tech tools, such as whiteboards, index cards, sticky notes. Without these tools, the collocated team members would not take the full advantage of agile best practices.<br/>It is unlikely that any of the team members would benefit from Gantt charts and project management information systems since these tools are typically used in traditional projects and, while not exclusively, are mainly intended for project managers rather than team members.<br/></p></div></div></div></div><br/>

The latter is concerned with monitoring stakeholder relationships and tailoring strategies for engaging stakeholders through modification of engagement strategies and plans. According to the scenario, the executive stakeholders are disengaged. Therefore, the project manager should work with them to determine what has to be done to improve the level of their engagement, which, hopefully, would contribute to their support for the project and eventually increase the chances of project success.<br/>According to the scenario, the executives are project stakeholders.

It is likely to be a long and, sometimes, painful process. If appropriately implemented, the project management approach will gradually shift from traditional to hybrid to agile. The first step, transitioning from predictive to hybrid, can be done by incorporating some of the agile elements into the existing predictive practices. Three answer choices describe practices used on agile projects. They include but are not limited to, developing the product in short iterations, incorporating daily standup meetings into the team's routine, holding team retrospectives at the end of each iteration, and many others. Only tracking the project progress using weekly meetings is a practice that is typically used on predictive projects. On agile projects, progress is readily available 24/7/365 using information radiators. Therefore, of the choices provided, tracking the project progress using weekly meetings is the least likely option for you to select.<br/>Unlike traditional projects, in which the product is developed during the entire period of project execution and then delivered at the end of the project, agile projects develop working product increments within short, typically two- to four-week iterations. This practice would help with the transition, making this choice an incorrect answer.<br/>The daily standup is a meeting that is used by project teams that typically work on agile projects. Adding this practice to a daily routine of the teams that work on predictive projects may help the organization with its transition from the predictive to agile project management approach, and is, therefore, not the 'least' likely option.<br/>Tracking the project progress using weekly meetings is an approach which is very typical for traditional projects. Since the question is asking for the 'least' likely option to help with the transition from the predictive to agile project methods, this choice represents the best answer to the question asked.<br/></p></div></div></div></div><br/>

Such a seemingly weird combination of agile and traditional methods results in a hybrid project management approach. It is possible that the organization is trying to gradually transition from the traditional to the agile approach and incorporating some agile elements into a ""well-oiled waterfall machine."" It is reasonable to assume that when such a transition takes place, not everything goes right the first time. For example, in the scenario, the product owner evaluates the technical change without consulting with the development team. Such an approach goes against the best agile practices. While the backlog prioritization is the ultimate responsibility of the product owner, it is the team who does the technical work and, therefore, must be involved in such decisions. The team estimates the work and provides information about technical dependencies. If the team is unable to develop a feature or implement a change due to technical limitations, the product owner should be aware of this and decide accordingly as to whether the change should be implemented and if yes, in which iteration. For example, the team may decide that the implementation of the change requires additional modifications to the product increment that should precede the change. This may not be feasible within the timeframe of the current iteration. In such a case, the product owner could have scheduled the change for a later iteration, thus preventing the problem from happening in the first place or, at least, decreasing the chances of the failure.<br/> Developing a risk response plan for the potential failure would not worsen the situation. However, it would not help it either, because risk responses are reactive in nature. Implementing the risk response would not have prevented the problem from happening in the first place.<br/>The scenario implies that the product development aspect of the project is managed using agile methods. In such an environment, changes to the product are evaluated by both the product owner and the team. The product owner decides on the priority after getting the team's input on estimates and any technical dependencies the change may have.<br/>Based on how the scenario is framed, the CCB is assigned to the project, inferring that all changes should go through the change control process established for the project. Approving the change without consulting with the CCB would likely go against the processes and procedures specified in the project management plan.<br/></p></div></div></div></div><br/>

This process is concerned with ensuring that the information needs of the project and its stakeholders are met. It can be reasonably assumed that the project is managed with traditional methods, as evident by the use of the communications management plan and the submission of a change request. However, when an agile practice, such as information radiators, is incorporated into a project, the project becomes hybrid. An information radiator is a physical or digital display that provides an up-to-date status of the project. The display if often located in a visible place accessible to stakeholders, allowing them to get an immediate status about the project. When digital information radiators are used, the project status can sometimes be updated even instantaneously, making it an ideal tool for those stakeholders who feels the current cadence of reporting the project status is not frequent enough or insufficient. Therefore, incorporating the use of information radiators is what the project manager should include in the change request.<br/>An information radiator is a physical or digital display that provides an up-to-date status of the project. The use of information radiators would best address the stakeholder's concern and is, therefore, what the project manager should include in the change request.<br/>Eliminating the distribution of the email reports that are currently sent to the stakeholders would diminish even further the value of information shared with the stakeholders and, therefore, is not the best option to include in the change request.<br/>It's a common misconception that daily standup meetings are aimed to provide project status. Project managers that are used to traditional methods tend to turn daily standups into status meetings, thus negating the benefit of what a daily standup is all about: a short, typically 15-min, meeting to report on work done yesterday (including any impediments to progress) and work planned for today.<br/></p></div></div></div></div><br/>

This approach embraces change, engages stakeholders continuously, and favors short development cycles to incrementally adjust the product based on the changing requirements, market demand, and feedback from the stakeholders. The smartphone project described in the scenario is one that predominantly has the above characteristics. However, one of the smartphone components, its camera, is going to be produced by an external vendor who is not willing to collaborate in an incremental way. This means that instead of integrating each new increment of the smartphone with the new increment of the camera, the project team will have to wait for the development of the camera to be completed and only then try to integrate the camera with the latest product increment of the smartphone. While this is not the best approach to manage a project, sometimes there is no other option. This situation can happen when a particular element of the project is either not executable using an agile approach or is non-negotiable, like in the scenario described where the vendor refuses to cooperate in an agile way. In such situations, the best approach to select is predominantly agile with some predictive components.<br/>

<br/>Most of the project requirements are unclear and will need to be elaborated as the project progresses. Under these circumstances, agile would be the best approach for the project. However, one component (the camera) is not part of the incremental development, forcing you to apply a predictive approach to the integration part of the project.<br/>With many anticipated changes, selecting predominantly a predictive approach for the project is not the best course of action. Projects with a lot of uncertainty are served best with agile methods that develop products incrementally. The integration of the components that are not delivered incrementally will have to follow the predictive approach.<br/> It is hard to impossible to create plans early in the project life cycle when requirements are unclear and will likely change a lot as the project progresses. Therefore, while executing the project using agile methods makes sense, selecting the predictive project management approach during planning does not sound like a good idea.<br/></p></div></div></div></div><br/>

Conversely, by welcoming changing requirements, even late in development, agile teams foster collaboration among the project stakeholders.<br/>Customer collaboration over contract negotiation is one of the Agile Manifesto values. This choice describes the opposite of the value and, therefore, is not the best answer to the question asked.<br/>This answer choice refers to the agile principle that encourages to build projects around motivated individuals and trust them to get the job done.

Motivated individuals who are trusted may get the job done by working in isolation or in a silo.<br/>Maintaining a constant pace indefinitely is one of the Agile Manifesto principles. This principle is aimed to promote sustainable development. However, this principle has little or nothing to do with collaboration. Maintaining a constant pace indefinitely is mainly intended to help individuals involved in the project maintain their work-life balance.<br/></p></div></div></div></div><br/>

The responsibility assignment matrix, work breakdown structure, and project team assignments contain information about project roles and responsibilities, but not specifically about the change control process. For that information, the project manager should consult the change management plan, which is specifically designed to provide direction for managing the change control process and documenting the roles and responsibilities of the CCB. The change management plan would specify the number of people needed to pass a vote, who has the authority to break ties when voting on change requests, and who may have the ability to overrule the committee. Therefore, the change management plan would be the best document to reference for verification of the chairperson's scope of authority.<br/>Project team assignments is a project document that provides information on the type of competencies and experience available in the project and the knowledge that may be missing. The project manager needs a document that will clarify the roles and responsibilities of the CCB. However, the project team assignments document does not provide this information.<br/>A responsibility assignment matrix (RAM) is a grid that shows the project resources assigned to each work package. Since the CCB is responsible for managing the change control process rather than executing work packages, the RAM is not designed to detail roles and responsibilities, as well as the rules and procedures, for the change control process.<br/>The work breakdown structure (WBS) is designed to show how project deliverables are broken down into work packages and provide a way of showing high-level areas of responsibility. The WBS does not describe the project’s change control process or the roles and responsibilities of CCB members.<br/></p></div></div></div></div><br/>

All answer choices describe the Agile Manifesto values, but only one is actually supported by the situation presented in the scenario. A simple and light change management process allows the customer in collaboration with the product owner to initiate the reprioritization of user stories. In doing so, it is reasonable to assume that the project changed its original plan, or, as the scenario states, the final product deviated from the original plan. By responding to the customer's needs with the implementation of a light change management process, the product owner and team helped ensure that the final deliverables contain the features most valued by the customer and that the project was completed on schedule and within budget. In other words, the value of responding to change over following the plan was most significantly demonstrated in the scenario.<br/>The scenario emphasizes the change management process, flexibility, welcoming, and accommodating changes while including the features that represented the highest value to the client. The scenario explicitly mentions that the final product deviates from the original design, making this choice, responding to change over following a plan, the best answer to the question asked.<br/>Although changes were accommodated through customer collaboration with the product owner and team, there was no mention of external or internal contracts, negotiation of which has been abandoned in favor of customer collaboration.<br/>The scenario describes the implementation of a light change management process. However, no specific details are provided as to whether or not individuals and interactions were valued over processes and tools. Therefore, while this choice represents a plausible answer, it is not the best response to the question asked.<br/></p></div></div></div></div><br/>

One can make the reasonable assumption that she has the necessary expertise in project management principles and practices to carry out an analogous or top-down project estimate. By using this technique, the project sponsor should be able to provide the steering committee with enough information for a review of the project. Later, once the project enters the planning stage, any rough order of magnitude (ROM) estimates created in initiation (-25% to +75%) should be revisited by the project manager and updated with new information to create definitive estimates (-5% to +10%).<br/>While this option presents a good idea, it is not the best choice since it involves the use of ‘external’ subject matter experts (SMEs). No project budget or funds have been committed to the project yet, nor is it clear from the question if any SMEs are available at such short notice. Moreover, the sponsor should first check the organization’s process assets library to find any relevant information that could be used in their project before seeking outside (likely paid) advice from experts.<br/>This answer choice describes analogous or top-down estimating. Analogous estimating is a technique to estimate the duration or cost of an activity or project using historical information. Analogous estimating is appropriate when the items being estimated are similar in nature, and those preparing the estimates have the needed expertise. Since the project sponsor is described as being successful in managing her past projects, it is reasonable to assume that she has the skills necessary to provide the steering committee with a preliminary project estimate using this technique.<br/>Bottom-up estimating uses the greatest level of specific detail available. Detailed estimates are then “rolled up” to higher levels for subsequent reporting and tracking purposes. Since the project has not yet been initiated, the WBS is not yet available; therefore, creating a bottom-up estimate is unlikely to be a plausible option.<br/></p></div></div></div></div><br/>

However, this information is not required to answer the question correctly. All is needed here is the understanding of the roles and responsibilities of various stakeholders in a typical agile project. The project team is responsible for the development of the product. The scrum master/agile coach (a.k.a., team facilitator) is a servant leader who motivates, inspires, and guides the team toward the project objectives. The product owner is responsible for the definition of the product to be developed by the team. Prioritizing the backlog and ensuring the backlog items are sufficiently elaborated are among the product owner's responsibilities. Therefore, of the choices provided, consulting with the product owner is the best answer to the question asked.<br/>Developing software code based on insufficient information may result in an incorrectly built feature.

While carrying out an architectural spike may look like a plausible option, another answer choice better addresses the question asked.<br/>Work items in the iteration backlog are prioritized according to their value to the customer. The prioritization is done by the product owner for a reason. Returning the item to the backlog and selecting another one defeats the purpose and may negatively impact the iteration goal. In an extreme case, if the iteration is canceled, all items developed before the cancellation can still be delivered to the customer.

In this situation, the project has already begun without a charter. However, the scenario does not provide details about how well the project is progressing. Projects without charters can suffer for multiple reasons. A project charter defines what the project should deliver and sets out management’s expectations for results. Therefore, without a charter, there are no clear expectations for project outcomes allowing the potential for the project to drift without any real results. Also, the project can face roadblocks due to the unavailability of resources and the project manager not having the written authority to acquire resources. Since the scenario does not give any details on the project other than it does not have a charter, and the project charter has significant benefits, the best answer to the question asked is to develop a charter at the point where you entered the project.<br/>Although the project is in execution, establishing a project charter is still beneficial. The project charter legitimizes the project and your authority. The charter also ensures there is a common understanding by the stakeholders of what the project will deliver as well as the roles and responsibilities of everyone involved in the project.<br/>Even though your project is in execution, establishing a project charter will be beneficial. Executives use the project charter to verify that the project is in line with corporate strategic goals.

The project charter is a document that, at a high level, ensures a common understanding by the stakeholders of key deliverables, milestones, and the roles and responsibilities of key project stakeholders. Although a project manager may assist with the development of the project charter, the charter must still be formally approved by an initiating entity such as a sponsor, project management office (PMO), or authorized representative. Therefore, before wrapping up the Develop Project Charter process, you should obtain the project charter's approval.<br/>The question suggests that the project charter has just been drafted. The project charter must be formally signed-off by the project initiator before the Develop Project Charter process described by the scenario can be completed.<br/>The question indicates that the project still needs to be formally authorized through the approval of the project charter, which means that conducting a project kick-off meeting at this point would be premature. A kick-off meeting typically takes place at the end of planning and the start of executing. According to the scenario, the project is in initiation.<br/>The question implies that the project charter has just been drafted.

Customer collaboration with the delivery team is a fundamental aspect of all agile methods. It is one of the reasons that agile projects have a high rate of success and an even higher rate of customer satisfaction. Getting the customer involved as part of the process helps ensure that what is being developed is of very high value and meets the customer's expectations. The greater the customer involvement, the greater the level of customer commitment to the success of the project. Coding standards are important, and having a vendor whose personnel are agile certified is a great benefit. However, without a regular flow of feedback from the customer, neither coding standards nor agile certified vendors would have as great an impact as regular contact and feedback between the customer and the vendor.<br/>

Note that the company in the scenario is a buyer, and the vendor is a seller. The ""customer"" refers to the buyer's customer. While it is reasonable to assume that the company in the scenario would be the one to interact with the vendor, the idea behind this question is to allow the customer to interact not only with the company but also with the company's vendors.<br/>Although it would be beneficial for the vendor staff to be agile certified practitioners, it is not a requirement when working with external vendors, whether the project is traditional, agile, or hybrid. Some government projects may have such a requirement. However, the scenario does not specify this.<br/>Many contracting approaches may be used when working with external vendors on an agile project. The most common types of contracts are fixed-price work packages and graduated fixed-price contracts. It is not required that a fixed-cost with incentives contract type be used.<br/>All agile methods require regular stakeholder and customer feedback. The most important thing to emphasize and establish with an external vendor on an agile project is that the project is structured to ensure that customers can provide regular feedback to the vendor during development.<br/></p></div></div></div></div><br/>

However quantitative risk analysis is not required for all projects nor is it always possible. The use of quantitative risk analysis depends on the availability of numeric data that can be assigned to project risks as well as specialized expertise. In addition, quantitative risk analysis is costly and typically takes more time to complete than qualitative risk analysis. Quantitative risk analysis is most likely appropriate for large or complex projects, which is not the case in the scenario described where you are leading a small project. When high-quality numeric data is unavailable, individual project risks are prioritized and assessed in qualitative risk analysis, giving the team a list of high-priority risks on which to focus their efforts. In situations where performing quantitative risk analysis is prohibitive, a qualitative risk analysis will be sufficient for the project's risk management efforts. In such instances, the project can proceed directly to the next process, Plan Risk Responses, making it the best answer to the question asked.<br/>Quantitatively evaluating risks is dependent on the ability to attain numerical data about individual project risks. When the data is not available, the project can proceed to the Plan Risk Responses process. While not ideal, this approach is better than making up data, which on its own, is an action that violates the PMI Code of Ethics and Professional Conduct.<br/>Releasing the project team and terminating the project is an extreme reaction that is not warranted under the circumstances described in the scenario. When high-quality numeric data is not available to carry our the Perform Quantitative Risk Analysis process, having the risks analyzed on a qualitative level and moving on to plan risk responses is a good project management practice.<br/> A qualitative risk analysis prioritizes risks by their probability of occurrence and impact allowing the team to focus efforts on high-priority risks. By trying to assign cost impacts to risks, you are trying to use quantitative risk analysis which is not appropriate for all projects. A quantitative risk analysis depends on the availability of high-quality data for project risks. Since you are struggling with attaining such data, a qualitative risk analysis will be sufficient.<br/></p></div></div></div></div><br/>

In the scenario, the team is implementing the activities specified in the quality management plan. Therefore, it can be reasonably assumed that the project team is carrying out the Manage Quality process. Quality is often seen as meeting the defined customer and stakeholder requirements. In agile projects, stakeholder engagement with the team ensures customer and stakeholder satisfaction is maintained throughout the project. Since, according to the scenario, the project manager is looking for an opportunity to test out some agile practices on the current project, and with the project team performing the Manage Quality process, encouraging continuous stakeholder engagement with the team members is the best course of action to achieve the goal set by the project manager.<br/>Both alternative analysis and document analysis are examples of the data analysis technique that can be used as part of the Manage Quality process implied by the scenario. Data analysis is typically associated with predictive projects. Also, each analysis has its own merits, and replacing one by another would not make the project more agile.<br/>One of the fundamental differences between traditional and agile projects is the level of stakeholder engagement/involvement. On traditional projects, the stakeholders are typically involved at key project milestones/gates. On agile projects, stakeholders are continuously involved and provide their input. Therefore, encouraging stakeholder engagement with the team would best meet the project manager's goal of incorporating some agile practices into the current project, making this choice the best answer to the question asked.<br/>While it is possible to make work more fun by incorporating some team-building activities into daily tasks, team-building activities have nothing to do with product testing and inspection.

Therefore, it can be assumed that the project, as a whole, is managed using the hybrid project management approach. Each iteration is a short, fixed time period to undertake work followed by a demonstration of functionality or design. Based on the demonstration, relevant stakeholders and the team hold a retrospective review. Demonstrations and reviews help check progress against the plan (e.g., performance measurement baseline) and determine if any changes to the project scope, schedule, or execution processes are necessary, which is exactly what the question asks.<br/>Iterations are typically used on agile and/or hybrid projects to incrementally develop deliverables. At the end of an iteration, the team demonstrates the product increment. Another meeting, retrospective, is held to review the process used by the team. Demonstrations help determine if any changes to the project scope or schedule are required; retrospectives identify what works well and what should be improved in the executing processes used by the team.<br/>It's a common misconception that daily standup meetings are aimed to provide project status. Project managers that are used to traditional methods tend to turn daily standups into status meetings, thus negating the benefit of what a daily standup is all about: a short, typically 15-min, meeting to report on work done yesterday (including any impediments to progress) and work planned for today.<br/>While it is reasonable to assume that changes will be requested on any project, change requests should be submitted as and when needed rather than at the beginning of each iteration. Without knowing specific details in the scenario, submitting a change request at the beginning of each iteration seems too prescriptive and unnecessary.<br/></p></div></div></div></div><br/>

Even if only the project manager remains on the project, the project manager is considered a member of the project team. Note, the PMBOK® Guide does not specify the order in which activities are performed during the Close Project or Phase process. However, it makes sense that the project team cannot be released until all other activities associated with the administrative closure of the project have been completed. For example, the responsibility for sending the survey to the stakeholders and analyzing the results can be delegated to a team member. Hence, of the available choices, releasing the project team is the last action that should be taken and is, therefore, the best answer to the question asked.<br/>This answer choice does represent an action associated with the administrative closure of the project. However, a member of the project team must be available to collect and analyze the survey information. Therefore, measuring stakeholder satisfaction must be completed before the project team can be released.<br/> Finalizing open claims is one of the steps completed during the administrative closure of the project. Claims may result as part of the procurement process. The question states that the project was completed exclusively with internal resources, which means that vendors were not used for the project. Therefore, it is not logical that any claims would exist in this scenario. Even if the project did have an open claim, this is not the last activity, of the available options, to be performed.<br/>Transferring the final product to operations is one of the tasks that should be completed for administrative closure of the project. However, one or more team members will be required to perform this activity. Therefore, the project team cannot be released until this activity is complete.<br/></p></div></div></div></div><br/>

However, even during the initial planning, to overcome uncertainty, agile/hybrid projects (or phases) may benefit from involving as many team members and stakeholders as possible.

These circumstances imply that an agile development cycle is being used within an overarching project management plan, making this project a hybrid. Given the fact that half of the development team has been reassigned, it is reasonable to assume that the existing project backlog will not be completed within the schedule baseline. With the limited information presented in this scenario, it is clear that the project scope and/or the schedule baseline will need to be adjusted, or the project might need to be terminated prematurely. When a project uses baselines to track performance, a modification to a baseline requires an approved change request. Unless stated otherwise in the scenario, the project manager lacks the authority to adjust baselines or terminate a project at will. The best course of action for the project manager in this scenario is to submit a change request to adjust the project scope and/or schedule baseline as necessary. Within the change control process, the changes need to be evaluated against all project constraints, and the authorized stakeholder(s) will need to decide on the best option.<br/> If the project scope and/or schedule cannot be adjusted, then the project may very well need to be terminated. However, the decision to cancel a project does not reside with the project manager. The project sponsor and any relevant stakeholders will need to evaluate the project based on the remaining resources and decide the fate of the project.<br/>A typical sprint length is two weeks, so this action would likely take six weeks to complete. Although establishing a new stable velocity might be useful information, the project manager should not delay the decisions that will inevitably need to be made. For example, if it is ultimately decided to terminate the project, then there would be a significant waste of resources resulting from the delay<br/>Since the size of the project team has been cut in half, the remaining team members would likely need to work twice as much to bridge the gap. Asking the team members to double their productivity for the remainder of the project is unsustainable and goes against acceptable project management practices regardless of the bonuses paid.<br/></p></div></div></div></div><br/>

Plan Stakeholder Engagement is the process of developing approaches to involve project stakeholders based on their needs, expectations, interests, and potential impact on the project. The stakeholder register is one of the inputs to this process. The stakeholder register is typically created during project initiation. The power/interest grid can be used to classify stakeholders according to their level of authority (power) and level of concern about the project's outcomes (interest). According to the scenario, the project sponsor's authority is low, which translates to low power; however, the sponsor's level of enthusiasm/concern about the project's outcomes is high, which means the sponsor's interest in the project is high. This means the project sponsor's classification will be displayed at the bottom-right quadrant of the power/interest grid.<br/>

Note, ideally, the project sponsor should have both the power and interest at their high level, i.e., the project sponsor's classification should be displayed at the top-right quadrant of the power/interest grid.<br/>Quadrant A represents stakeholders with a high level of authority (power), but a low level of concern about the project's outcomes (interest). In the scenario, the project sponsor is described as a stakeholder with a low level of authority (low power) but enthusiastic, i.e., having a high level of concern about the project's outcomes (high interest). This classification falls into quadrant D, not A.<br/>Quadrant B represents stakeholders with a high level of authority (power) and a high level of concern about the project's outcomes (interest). In the scenario, the project sponsor is described as a stakeholder with a low level of authority (low power) but enthusiastic about the project's outcomes (high interest). This classification falls into quadrant D, not B.<br/>Quadrant C represents stakeholders with a low level of authority (power) and a low level of concern about the project's outcomes (interest).

Also, since the identified risk did not occur, the unused contingency reserve may be removed from the project budget to free up resources for other projects or operations. Updating the risk register and releasing the funds is what you should do next. While the choice: “Update the lessons learned register to reflect that the contingency reserve was not necessary” is a plausible answer, it is not what the project manager would do 'next', it is something the project manager could do to ensure the information is available to other projects. This would be done after the risk register was updated and the contingency funds released.<br/>

Note, since the contingency reserves are part of the cost baseline, an approved change request would be required to release the funds. However, this option is not provided. Therefore, of the choices given, updating the risk register and releasing the associated contingency reserves is the best answer to the question asked.<br/>The risk register should be updated to reflect the status of the outdated risk.

Of course, in the real world, you would elect to have both a skilled facilitator and a detailed agenda, but the PMP exam will expect the PMP aspirant to decide which answer will provide a better outcome.<br/>
A facilitator can help keep you, and everyone else, on track. Lessons learned sessions don’t deliver any value when the discussion only focuses on what went wrong. A facilitator can help guide the group to turn negatives into positives by eliciting what can be done differently in the future and develop concrete actions to make sure the problems do not recur on the project. Developing a detailed agenda might have been a helpful tool to keep the meeting on track and make sure that more was discussed other than just what went wrong. However, as anyone with experience in running meetings knows, an agenda by itself will not keep a meeting on track. A skilled facilitator can ensure that meeting objectives are met with or without a detailed agenda. Therefore, of the available choices, using a skilled facilitator provides the best strategy to ensure meeting objectives are met.<br/>Developing a detailed agenda might have been a helpful tool to keep the meeting on track and make sure that more was discussed other than just what went wrong.

Individual and team assessments are among the tools and techniques associated with the Develop Team process, the implementation of which should be documented in the resource management plan. The information gleaned from conducting individual and team assessments can then be used to create the team performance assessments.<br/>

Individual and team assessments can be incorporated into the existing iteration retrospectives as the project team should be discussing their processes and how they interact as a team in order to identify areas for improvement. Thus, the individual and team assessments are aligned with the primary purpose of the iteration retrospective. For example, team member attitudes toward the project and other team members can be assessed, and gaps in training and development might be identified. The servant-leader should facilitate the iteration retrospective and ensure that any developmental needs are identified so they can be addressed as part of continuous improvement efforts.<br/>A daily standup meeting is a time-boxed and narrowly focused meeting for the development team to coordinate their daily activities. This would be an inappropriate time to conduct surveys and assessments. Additionally, collecting this information on a daily basis would not be a good use of time and resources as the results are unlikely to change significantly from one day to the next.<br/>Conducting a project retrospective is a good idea. However, the project retrospective is conducted at the end of the project and would not be particularly useful for continuous improvement efforts throughout the project. Additionally, the question indicates that a team performance assessment must be produced monthly rather than just at the end of the project.<br/>An iteration retrospective is conducted at the end of each iteration (typically two weeks) and provides the team with an opportunity to review their processes to uncover opportunities for improvement.

There is a time a place for relationship building and providing a way for casual conversation is important. To avoid distracting the other team members, these off-topic conversations need to be incorporated in a manner that does not interfere with project work. Establishing a separate channel for topics unrelated to the project and politely asking the team members to use it, represents an appropriate balance between the project work and team building.<br/>The question indicates that the off-topic conversations are distracting, which is an issue that should be addressed. People need to use the tool to build and reinforce the team, but they need to do it without impeding other communication.<br/>It is important for the project team members to be able to establish positive working relationships, and it is unrealistic to avoid some personal interactions. Replacing the tool with email and phone is likely to be an ineffective approach and may even demoralize the team. Additionally, neither email nor phone can prevent non-work related conversations.<br/>Too much conversation that is unrelated to work may annoy some people, causes a distraction, and important information may be lost in the jocular banter.<br/></p></div></div></div></div><br/>

Technical aspects of the project, on the other hand, are not yet fully defined and will be elaborated as the project progresses. This implies some agile practices will be required to manage these unclear aspects, resulting in an overall hybrid project management approach. Project environments subject to various elements of ambiguity and change have an inherent need to communicate evolving and emerging details more frequently and quickly. In such environments, project managers should encourage frequent team checkpoints, the use of information radiators, and holding regular stakeholder reviews. While it is unclear whether sending the project report on a weekly basis considered by the sponsor to be frequent enough, the incorrect answer choices describe agile communication practices that would support the need for frequent and quick communication of project information. Sending the project report on a weekly basis is the only choice that stands out as ""non-agile"" and, therefore, will likely be an exception to your selection of tools and techniques, making this choice the best answer to the question asked.<br/>Frequent team checkpoints refer to agile practices such as daily standups, iteration reviews, retrospectives, etc. While it is unclear from the scenario if the team can or need to meet daily and whether the deliverables are built using iterations, frequent team checkpoints would address the sponsor request for more frequent and quick communication.<br/>Unlike traditional projects where stakeholders are involved in key milestones and gates, agile projects benefit from regular stakeholder reviews and continuous engagement. Conducting regular stakeholder reviews would support the sponsor's request to have more frequent and quick communications on the project.<br/>Information radiators are visible physical or digital displays that provide information to the rest of the organization enabling up-to-the-minute knowledge sharing.

According to the scenario, the project is in execution. While in hybrid projects, as the one described in the scenario, requirements can be collected as part of iteration planning, gathering data about velocity, costs, and quality would not significantly contribute to requirements gathering.<br/>It makes sense that collecting data at an iteration level about the speed at which the deliverables are produced (velocity), actual costs spent by the team, quality of the deliverables, and then summing up these trends and extrapolating them at a project level is done to monitor, track, and estimate the overall performance of the project.<br/>It is possible that the data collected (velocity, costs, quality) can provide an insight into the quality of deliverables. However, quality is only one aspect of the data collected by the project manager in the scenario described. Another answer choice more accurately addresses the question asked.<br/></p></div></div></div></div><br/>

The principle states, ""Welcome changing requirements, even late in development. Agile processes harness change for the customer's competitive advantage."" Agile project management is based on short-terms stability but long-term flexibility. Short-term stability refers to the fact that once the agile project team starts working on developing the product increment planned for the sprint, no changes can be requested by the customer, product owner, or other project stakeholders. This is referred to as reciprocal commitment. Long-term flexibility refers to the fact that while the project team is performing the work during a sprint, the product owner allows the customer to change requirements in subsequent sprints, based on those user stories that, at that particular point in the project, represent either the highest value or the highest risk.<br/>

Note, exceptions may apply in various situations, for example, when the requested feature is critical for the customer, or required by regulations, or the risk associated with the feature is high so that postponing the development of the feature may result in even higher risk to the project, to name but a few. According to the scenario, however, there is no urgency associated with the feature. Therefore, including the feature in the current sprint two days before its end makes little sense.<br/>Agile best practices suggest that the product owner should let the team finish the work that has been assigned to the team members for the current sprint and then, with the customer, prioritize the feature that has been forgotten by the customer in the product backlog.<br/>A change request is typically required on traditionally managed projects or projects that incorporate hybrid methods with a change control system in place. Since the scenario only indicates that an agile project is underway, it is reasonable to assume that new features or modifications to the existing ones do not require a change request.<br/>The team members should continue their focus on completing the work assigned to them in the current sprint. Developing a new feature without evaluating its value, risk, and other criteria two days before the sprint's planned end date seems like an uninformed ""knee-jerk"" reaction.<br/></p></div></div></div></div><br/>

Inherently, these high-variability environments incur more uncertainty and risk. To address this, agile practices promote frequent reviews of increment work product and cross-functional project teams to accelerate knowledge sharing and ensure that risk is understood and managed. Risk is considered when selecting the content of each sprint, and risks are also identified, analyzed, and managed during each sprint. Additionally, projects that experience a high degree of uncertainty and change require active engagement and participation with project stakeholders. Agile projects encourage frequent and continuous engagement with stakeholders, thus helping mitigate risk, build trust, and support adjustment earlier in the project cycle, thus reducing costs and increasing the likelihood of the project success. Therefore, of the choices provided, engaging stakeholders frequently in the review of the product increments developed by the team is the best answer to the question asked.<br/>In agile projects, the risk is addressed in each sprint as part of backlog prioritization. Once the sprint is over, the stakeholders review the product increment and provide their feedback. This course of action allows the agile teams to increase review frequency with appropriate stakeholders, thus resulting in early risk mitigation at a minimal cost.<br/>Risk-based spikes can be conducted to address project risks. However, these efforts are carried out by the project team members, rather than stakeholders. Additionally, risk-based spikes performed as needed, rather than in each sprint.<br/>It is true that the high-risk user stories should be properly prioritized to address risk early in the project. However, this activity is performed by the product owner in collaboration with the team and other relevant stakeholders (including the sponsor, if needed), but not exclusively with the sponsor.<br/></p></div></div></div></div><br/>

To assist the project team monitor and control the costs and schedule of an iteration, a burndown chart displays the planned work to be completed and the associated costs or resources allocated to work. Typically, the burndown chart begins with the sum value of the work on the left then trends down to the end point of the iteration. All the work is expected to be done at the end of the iteration. Hence, the endpoint is to be at zero for work and costs remaining. The ideal burndown rate line is that straight line from the start of the iteration to the last point in the iteration when all the work is to be done. Work completed faster than planned has a steeper slope than the ideal line. That line is reaching the zero work remaining point faster.<br/>The remaining work line will be above the ideal burndown rate if the work is being completed behind schedule. In the scenario, work is being completed well ahead of schedule implying the remaining work line is below, not above, the ideal burndown rate.<br/> At the start of the iteration, the ideal burndown rate of the work and costs are mapped. The ideal burndown rate typically is a straight line from the total of story points at the start to zero at the end of the iteration.

The purpose of a retrospective meeting is to provide team members an opportunity to analyze the processes the team uses to develop the project deliverables and determine what improvements can be made so that the next iteration (or next cycle in flow-based agile) will be more effective and productive. These facilitated meetings may include the elements, such as setting up the stage, gathering data, generating insights, deciding what to do, and finally closing the retrospective. As stated by the Scrum Guide, ""The Sprint Retrospective is an opportunity for the Scrum Team to inspect itself and create a plan for improvements to be enacted during the next Sprint"".<br/> Demonstrating the product increment to the customer and relevant stakeholders is part of the sprint review meeting. The team is looking for feedback on the product, rather than on the process used by the team to develop the product. Sprint review meetings are not intended for the team to reflect and adapt.<br/>Selecting user stories for the next sprint typically happens at sprint planning meetings. While some review to evaluate the team's progress may happen during the sprint planning meeting, such as measuring the team's velocity to ensure the plan for the next sprint sounds reasonable, this scrum event is not the right forum to reflect and adapt.<br/>The on-going work, such as the items completed the last day, work planned for today, as well as any impediments to progress, are usually discussed at the daily standup meetings. These meetings are short time-boxed events that are not aimed to reflect on and adapt the processes used by the team.<br/></p></div></div></div></div><br/>

</div></div> </div></div></div><div class='answer'><a class='ans' onclick='showHide(434)'>Ans</a><p style='display:none;' id='ans_434'>4--The question involves two processes: Acquire Resources (independent contractors are hired for the project team) and Conduct Procurements (external resources, which could be both physical and human, are procured). Advertising, that was used by the project manager to attract potential contractors, is a tool or technique of the Conduct Procurement process. Decision making is one of the tools and techniques that may be used as part of the Acquire Resources process.<br/>

The context of the question (procuring resources for the project team) suggests that of the two processes, Acquire Resources and Conduct Procurements, the former is likely the process one should focus on. Decision-making techniques that can be used in the Acquire Resources process include multicriteria decision analysis. With multicriteria decision analysis, criteria are developed and used to rate or score potential resources (applicants for contract work in this case). The criteria are weighted according to their relative importance and values, and can then be applied to the candidate pool to determine the best applicants to serve on the project team. Of the choices provided, using the multicriteria decision analysis tool will be most helpful for the project manager in selecting the project team members from a large list of qualified applicants and is, therefore, what the project manager should do next.<br/>Source selection criteria is a set of attributes desired by the buyer which a seller is required to meet or exceed to be selected for a contract. However, the question states that the candidate list has already been narrowed down to those that are qualified to perform the project work. Therefore, the source selection criteria have already been applied to the candidate pool, making this answer choice a redundant step.<br/>The resource management plan may be updated to reflect actual experience in acquiring resources for the project. However, based on the scenario, the project team members have not yet been selected from the candidate pool. Therefore, submitting a change request to update the resource management plan is premature.<br/>The lessons learned repository is a store of historical information about lessons learned in past projects. When the project is in progress, it is the lessons learned register, not the repository, that should be updated to document the experience of using social media to acquire contractors. Therefore, updating the lessons learned repository is not what the project manager should do next.<br/></p></div></div></div></div><br/>

The challenge in the scenario described is that some of the requirements that the business is planning to outsource to a vendor are stable while others are not. When some deliverables have well-known requirements while others will have to be discovered and elaborated as the project progresses, applying a hybrid project management approach for the contracting work is likely to be the best course of action. This means that the business may use a predictive approach for some deliverables and an adaptive approach for other parts. In these cases, a governing agreement, such as a master services agreement (MSA) may be used for the overall engagement, with the adaptive work being placed in an appendix or supplement. This allows changes to occur on the adaptive scope without impacting the overall contract. Therefore, using the master services agreement (MSA) is the best answer to the question asked.<br/>Prior to proposal submittal, the buyer and prospective sellers (vendors) can use meetings to ensure that all vendors have a clear and common understanding of the procurement, and no vendors receive preferential treatment. Some of the names of these meetings are bidder conferences, vendor conferences, contractor conferences. These conferences are not used to contract with a vendor, as asked by the question, but rather to clarify the procurement requirements. This answer choice is intentionally misleading, combining similar terms (vendor and contractor) in the same concept, such as bidder conferences.<br/>. Request for proposal (RFP) is an example of a bid document that can be used as part of the Plan Procurement Management process. An RFP is used in cases when there is a problem in the project, and the solution is not easy to determine. The RFP is not used to contract with a seller, but to solicit sellers' responses with a proposed solution.<br/>A master services agreement (MSA) is a contract between the buyer and seller that can be used with a hybrid project management approach when the overall engagement for the contracted work is documented in the main part of the MSA, while the adaptive portion of the work is placed in an appendix or supplement.<br/></p></div></div></div></div><br/>

However, organizational culture, along with the attitudes of the project team, indicate a very high reluctance to adopt an agile framework. This reluctance could be the result of fear of the unknown, or a bad experience the team had with a previous attempt at an agile project. Regardless of the reason, it is clear that the team will be highly resistant to adopting an agile framework. It is incumbent upon the project manager to balance the needs of the project, team, and culture when determining the optimal project management framework. In this case, it is unlikely that forcing an agile approach upon the project team will result in a successful project.<br/>

Additionally, just because the project team strongly prefers the waterfall approach does not mean that their attitudes cannot be changed over time. Therefore, the best approach would be to begin the project with a predictive model and then begin introducing some agile practices. If the team members experience some quick wins with the new practices, they may be more open to adopting more agile practices, which may speed delivery. Incorporating agile practices within an overarching predictive framework will result in a hybrid project management approach.<br/>Allowing the team to have some input into the selection of the project management framework might be a good idea. However, in this case, the team is likely to be highly experienced with the predictive model but may lack a fundamental understanding of the benefits of agile practices. As a result, the team will likely select the predictive approach out of comfort and familiarity, and that might not be the optimal framework for the project.<br/>The radar chart indicates that there is little or no buy-in for using agile methodologies. Selecting a waterfall model would undoubtedly be the path of least resistance for the project team. However, the characteristics of the project indicate that an agile approach may be more appropriate for this particular project. The project manager will need to balance the organizational and team culture with the needs of the project.<br/>The project characteristics are certainly an essential factor in determining the appropriate project management framework. However, going with agile would ignore the team preferences as well as the organizational culture. To determine the best approach, the project manager must balance the project, team, and organizational culture.<br/></p></div></div></div></div><br/>

</div></div> </div></div></div><div class='answer'><a class='ans' onclick='showHide(440)'>Ans</a><p style='display:none;' id='ans_440'>4--Incorporating some of the agile elements into a large and complex traditionally managed project is frequently a challenge. Agile practices encourage high visibility of work, which is not always the case with traditional projects. As it pertains to release management, on smaller projects that are lead using agile, the product backlog is sufficient to manage the project and provide enough visibility to the team and stakeholders. As a hybrid project grows in size and complexity, to help establish both product focus and project visibility, a release planning session and a release plan are required. The use of multi-level release planning can ensure that both product focus and project visibility remain high and that there is a clear product roadmap that ties together the entire project effort. Agile release planning provides a high-level summary timeline of the release schedule based on the product roadmap and the product vision. Agile release planning also determines the number of iterations in the release and allows the product owner and team to decide on the amount of work to be done and the timeline for this work to be completed.<br/>A project that is planned and executed with a well-defined beginning and end is non-agile in its very nature. Agile project management focuses on the continuous delivery of value and working product, and not specifically on a predetermined beginning and end.<br/>A WBS is a hierarchical decomposition of the project work. While it is possible to combine some of the agile practices with traditional methods, making the project hybrid as is in the scenario described, creating a detailed WBS would likely interfere with the goal of keeping some of the project aspects agile and less process and structure focused.<br/>Building a hierarchy of processes and decision making focuses the project on documentation, adherence, and ceremony, and away from the delivery of value and increments of function or value. While large projects are often planned with a hierarchy of functionality, this is much different from hierarchical processes and decision-making.<br/></p></div></div></div></div><br/>

However, a high volume of new features, change requests, and defect repairs suggest that agile or, at least, hybrid methods would have worked better. While switching the project management approach midway into project execution is not always feasible or advisable, unless stated otherwise in the scenario, the project manager, in consultation with the team and relevant stakeholders, is free to choose any approach they assume would work better. When agile practices ""meet"" a traditionally managed project, the approach becomes hybrid. With agile methods, a product is built incrementally over the course of short iterations. Progress can be measured frequently from iteration to iteration, allowing the next iteration to be planned based on real progress rather than based on estimates made up-front when little information about the project was available. When a project operates in an environment full of new features, change requests, and defect repairs, up-front estimating would likely be inaccurate. Therefore, switching the product development approach to adaptive and measuring progress via short iterations is the best course of action for the project manager to take in this situation. Ideally, a change request is required to modify the development approach which is specified in the project management plan. However, this answer choice is not provided.<br/>

Note: variance analysis used in the scenario is an example of data analysis tools and techniques that can be applied with any of the processes of the Monitoring and Controlling Process Group. This technique identifies the differences (variance) between planned and actual performance.<br/>The question asks to find the best approach to ensure that further estimates are made based on real progress, with the ""real progress"" being the key words. With adaptive/iterative approach, progress can be measured frequently, every iteration, thus allowing the estimates for the upcoming iteration to be more realistic.<br/> It is true that predictive projects, such as the one described in the scenario, try to minimize the number of changes. However, limiting the number of new features, change requests, and defect repairs 'allowed' on the project, even one managed traditionally, sounds like an unreasonable approach.<br/>This answer choice describes examples of various estimating techniques that could be used to estimate cost and time. The term ""estimating"" is less applicable to scope. Regardless, the question is asking about the best course of action to ensure that estimates are made based on 'real progress'. None of these techniques are based on real progress.<br/></p></div></div></div></div><br/>

A fundamental principle of the crystal framework is the use of physical colocation to enhance collaboration and benefit from osmotic communication. Osmotic communication is a byproduct of physical colocation where information can flow in the background, and team members can learn almost as if by osmosis. In this scenario, the project will transition from an agile phase to a predictive phase with a virtual team. Therefore, osmotic communication will most likely be lost in the transition, and the project manager will need to utilize virtual tools to facilitate collaboration with the geographically dispersed team.<br/>

Note, it is reasonable to assume that product development and the approval process will be performed by different teams. Therefore, the loss of osmotic communication does not refer to the same team. The idea behind this question is to understand that osmotic communication typically refers to a team that operates in a collocated environment. However, the question does not ask about a specific team. Rather, it asks about the impact on the project as a whole. Therefore, of the choices provided, the loss of osmotic communication is considered the best answer.<br/>Crystal is an agile methodology. Agile methodologies provide support for self-organizing teams versus a more command and control approach that is typical within a predictive framework. In this scenario, the project management approach will likely transition from a collaborative approach to a more command and control one.<br/>Osmotic communication is a fundamental principle of crystal methodologies. Osmotic communication is the information that flows in the background and is absorbed by the project team by osmosis. Osmotic communication is a byproduct of physical colocation. Teams operating in a virtual environment would not benefit from osmotic communication.<br/>With traditional waterfall projects, the work breakdown structure (WBS) is fully decomposed during project planning. With agile methodologies, such as crystal, the project scope will be captured at high-level and then progressively elaborated throughout the project. Therefore, in this case, the project scope will transition from being progressively elaborated during product development to being fully decomposed during project planning for the approval phase.<br/></p></div></div></div></div><br/>

When using a traditional waterfall approach, the tasks required to complete the required project work are typically assigned to specific individuals and recorded in the project schedule. Agile teams are self-organizing and self-managing, which is contrary to a predictive approach. When using an agile model, the elements of the product are captured in a prioritized product backlog and assigned at the team level rather than specific individuals. The team then collaborates to complete the project work. Therefore, in this scenario, it would be most appropriate to transition from individual to team-based performance criteria for recognition and rewards.<br/>When using agile methodologies, e.g., Scrum, as described in the scenario, the project team has collective responsibility for completing the required work. It would be, therefore, appropriate to transition from individual to team-based performance criteria.<br/>T-shaped people are generalizing specialists, and I-shaped people are specialists. Agile teams that are comprised of generalizing specialists are typically more successful than teams of specialists. Generalizing specialists offer greater flexibility, which improves throughput. Recognizing I-shaped individuals would not be aligned with the Scrum phase.<br/> Agile methodologies, such as Scrum, are characterized by high rates of change. Agile principles embrace change for the customer's benefit.

When incorporating an agile lifecycle, the project deliverables will be produced incrementally and iteratively. By the end of each iteration, the project team will have delivered a product increment that represents business value. There are a variety of ways that stakeholders might be apprised of the delivery of business value, and the strategy for communicating this information should be recorded in the communications management plan and/or the stakeholder engagement plan when a project is operated under the auspices of a project management plan. The correct answers represent several strategies that might be employed to keep the key stakeholders informed of the project's progress and the delivery of business value in this hybrid environment. The incorrect answer choices represent anti-patterns when incorporating agile methodologies.<br/>

We intentionally used the word ""apprise"" in order to represent one of the tasks of the PMP® Examination Content Outline. The task reads: ""Apprise stakeholders of value gain progress.""<br/>When using an agile development cycle, project deliverables will be produced and delivered iteratively. Typically, at the end of each iteration, the project team will demonstrate the product increment to gain acceptance.

From the way the question is framed, it seems that past projects were managed using a predictive project management approach, as evident from the change control process that was ineffective in handling changes and allowing scope creep. On predictive projects, stakeholder involvement is usually limited to milestones and gates. This often leads to a disconnection between stakeholders and the team. The project manager understands this and decides to institute regular interactions with the stakeholder community throughout the project, a practice that is typical for agile projects. Incorporating an agile practice into a traditional project makes the project hybrid. Such practice may help in mitigating risk, building trust, and supporting adjustments earlier in the project life cycle, thus reducing costs and increasing the likelihood of project success. However, it is unclear if regular interactions with the stakeholder community throughout the project would reduce (or increase) scope. It is reasonable to assume that these interactions would lead to a better-defined scope since the stakeholders will provide their feedback. The reduced scope is the 'least' likely outcome of the project manager's decision and is, hence, the best answer to the question asked.<br/>When stakeholders are regularly involved and provide their feedback on the product under development, it is likely that the scope will be better defined. However, this does not necessarily mean that the scope will be reduced. Therefore, of the choices provided, the reduced scope is the 'least' likely outcome of the project manager's decision.<br/>Regular interactions with stakeholders would result in more frequent feedback on the product being developed, thus allowing the project team to adjust the product based on stakeholder needs and reduce the risk of building something that does not meet stakeholder expectations.<br/>When stakeholders are regularly involved and provide their feedback on the product under development, the project team will have a better understanding of stakeholder needs and expectations.

Projects with high risks are better served by agile, rather than traditional methods. However, when risk management processes are properly performed, any project management approach would work as long as the stakeholders are aware of the pros and cons of each approach. It is not required to know the real motive of the client behind the selection of the project management approach to answering the question. It is important, however, to notice that according to the scenario, the team will need to rely on the client's representative who will be able to clarify requirements and provide ongoing feedback. This approach is very typical of agile, where this role is often performed by a product owner who continuously works with the development team to clarify and prioritize requirements and provide inputs to ensure that the correct project outputs are being delivered. The product owner is a project stakeholder. Stakeholders are identified as part of the Identify Stakeholders process. Therefore, of the choices provided, Identify Stakeholders is the process the project manager should use to identify the client's representative.<br/>

Note, when a traditional project meets agile practices, such as in the scenario described, the overall project management approach becomes hybrid.<br/>""Identify Representatives"" is not a process specified in the PMBOK® Guide. This is a made-up term we created for this question.<br/>Identify Risks is the process of identifying individual project risks for further analysis or action. This process is not used to identify individuals or groups that can clarify requirements and provide ongoing feedback for the product/service being developed.<br/> Identify Stakeholders is, in short, the process of identifying project stakeholders. Of the choices provided, only Identify Stakeholders is the process that may help the project manager with the identification of the individual who can represent the client in clarifying requirements and providing ongoing feedback to the team on the project deliverables.<br/></p></div></div></div></div><br/>

A story point is the typical unit of measure to estimate work items in the product backlog. The most important aspect to understand here is the relativity of the story point. The story point is a unit-less measure used in relative user story estimation techniques. Each team will have its own understanding of the size of the story point. Therefore, comparing story point estimates provided by two different teams would make no sense. The team's capacity is measured in story points. Capacity is the number of story points that a team completes in a predefined period of time, e.g., an iteration. Since each agile team interprets the size of the story point differently, each team would have its own capacity. This concept of each agile team having its own capacity is what the project manager most likely does not understand in the scenario provided.<br/>Answer choices with absolute statements, such as ""always"", ""never"", etc. typically represent incorrect answers. Saying that estimates expressed in story points 'always' look high would be inaccurate, to say the least.<br/>A story point is a relative unit of measure. Each agile team would likely have its own understanding of how much work is involved in completing one story point. Hence, each agile team will have its own capacity and, therefore, cannot be compared with another team, regardless of how similar the projects the teams are working on may look like.<br/>It is possible that the team is using padding to secure its estimates. However, comparing estimates provided by two different agile teams is a flawed approach since the size of a story point differs from one team to another, thus, implying that the capacity of one team would differ from the capacity of another team.<br/></p></div></div></div></div><br/>

The lessons learned register is a project document used to record knowledge gained during a project (or phase) so that it can be used in the current project and entered into the lessons learned repository at the end of the project or phase. The question indicates that the knowledge gained came from the project documents of the current phase, which suggests that the knowledge was previously captured in the lessons learned register.

A project manager needs an approved change request to increase the management reserves. Also, increasing the management reserves for a subsequent phase based on the ineffective risk responses of a previous phase is not good project management practice.<br/>While updating the risk management plan for the third phase is a plausible option, it is not the next step for you to take. First, all activities associated with the closure of the second phase should be completed. Even then, the next phase of the project does not start with the development or update of the risk management plan. Additionally, risk responses for particular risks are specified in the risk register, not in the risk management plan.<br/>The lessons learned register is a project document that is not typically subject to a formal change control process.

Negotiation is one of the tools and techniques which may be useful during the Manage Stakeholder Engagement process. It is best to negotiate a reasonable solution to the problem described in the question to retain the stakeholder's support for the project. Since the change request to replace all of the barcode scanners was denied, there is no point in resubmitting the same request. However, just replacing the broken scanners seems like a reasonable solution that might be best for the stakeholder and the project. The change control board (CCB) might approve replacing the broken scanners even if they denied replacing all of the scanners previously. Therefore, of the available choices, the best course of action is to offer to assist the stakeholder by submitting a change request to replace only the broken scanners.<br/>

Note that the concern raised by the key stakeholder should be captured in the issue log as well. However, updating the issue log was not listed as an answer choice. On the real exam, the PMP aspirant will likely encounter situations where the obvious answer is not listed as an option, and the 'best' answer must be selected from the available choices.<br/>This answer choice represents the interpersonal and team skill of negotiation. It is best to negotiate a reasonable solution to the concern raised by the stakeholder to retain their support for the project.<br/>While the question describes a project with a tight budget, the scenario does not provide the reason for the rejection of the change request. If it did, explaining the rationale for the denial may be necessary. However, it does not resolve the stakeholder's concern.<br/> Issues beyond the authority of the project manager will likely be addressed by the project sponsor. However, the project sponsor should only be involved when other alternatives that are under the control of the project manager have been exploited. There is another answer choice that describes a plausible option without the need of escalating to the project sponsor.<br/></p></div></div></div></div><br/>

Physical colocation provides benefits in improved communication and collaboration. In this scenario, the project was planned to take advantage of the benefits of a co-located project team. However, unforeseen and extreme circumstances now prevent the project team from being physically co-located. Therefore, the best course of action is to organize the team members as a virtual team and replicate colocation as closely as possible using virtual tools. Although not ideal, the effective use of virtual tools can gain most of the benefits of colocation in a virtual environment. Since this project is being operated under the umbrella of a predictive approach, an approved change request will be required to revise the resource management plan and possibly other elements of the project management plan.<br/>Since physical colocation is no longer an option, the best course of action is to replicate colocation as closely as possible using virtual tools. Since the resource management plan requires colocation, an approved change request would be required to modify the relevant section of the plan that specifies the team's working environment.<br/>This answer choice represents actions that should be taken in order to mitigate the negative effects of the new project constraint described in the scenario. Although you would likely be able to examine virtual team member needs and investigate alternatives, you would not be able to 'implement' options for virtual team member engagement without first obtaining an approved change request for this action.<br/>While an approved change request to update various elements of the project management plan would be necessary to change the project lifecycle from hybrid to predictive, there is no information presented by the question to suggest this action would mitigate the problem described in the scenario.<br/></p></div></div></div></div><br/>

Such a combination of methods from different project management methodologies results in a hybrid project management approach. In the scenario, the product is developed in iterations, which typically (although not always) means the work items are organized as a backlog. The backlog is a list of work items prioritized by the product owner in consultation with the team and relevant stakeholders. New features/requirements, changes to existing features, and defect repairs for already developed product increments are considered work items. Therefore, it makes sense for the work to be carried out using a single-list-of-work-and-changes approach.<br/>The requirements traceability matrix is a project document in the form of a grid that links product requirements from their origin to the deliverables that satisfy them. This document does not have any guidelines as to how work to implement requirements, changes, and defect repairs should be carried out on a project.<br/>Organizational process assets (OPAs) are the processes, policies, and procedures specific to and used by the performing organization. While the OPAs may contain guidelines on how work should be carried out in the organization in general, each project has its own specific instructions, typically outlined in the project management plan.<br/>This term, 'single-list-of-work-and-changes' refers to the product backlog, which is, as its name implies, a list of items such as requirements, changes, and defect repairs that should be completed during the project. The list is prioritized, and the items are pulled out by the project team from the top of the backlog.<br/></p></div></div></div></div><br/>

However, other considerations beyond profitability should be taken into account. One important consideration includes the financial obligation for providing employment to the newly hired developers after the project is concluded. If the performing organization feels that they will not need additional developers after the current project is complete, then it may make sense to use contractors instead of hiring developers even though the project will be less profitable as a result.

Although social media may be very prevalent in some regions, not all people embrace the use of social media, especially when the stakeholders come from different cultures all across the world as described by the scenario. Cultural awareness is an understanding of the difference between individuals, groups, and organizations and adapting the project's communication strategy in the context of these differences. While some of the project's stakeholders or team members may be interested in using the social media tool, the requirement to create an account for the tool may be challenging for others to get everyone engaged with the idea.

The fact that the stakeholders use different computers and mobile devices is not likely to be a significant issue.<br/> Although some companies may not allow the use of social media tools, these tools have been used successfully on many projects.

Although all of the answer choices are possible responses to the changes introduced to the project described in the scenario, only one actually follows agile best practices. Working with all project stakeholders to reprioritize the remaining features on the project and preparing a new product roadmap and product backlog to meet the original project completion date is the best response in this situation. Collaboration increases the chances of getting the needed buy-in from the stakeholders. This approach helps to ensure that the reduced and reprioritized project backlog is accepted by all those who are involved in the project. Implementing this response to the organizational change will give the new company owners and other relevant stakeholders confidence that the team will meet the re-defined project objectives.<br/>Given the project has lost resources, it is unlikely that all of the features or user stories will be able to be completed within the established timeline with reduced resources. Reprioritizing the remaining features in the product backlog is an agile best practice whenever scope, resources, or deadline changes.<br/>Agile best practices aim to establish development processes that are sustainable. Overtime and extra hours are indications that the development process is unhealthy/unsustainable. This is a poor example of adapting to change.<br/>Evaluating the project resources is a helpful practice, but does nothing to address the challenge of a static project deadline, unchanged scope (the number of user stories to develop remains the same), and reduced staff.<br/></p></div></div></div></div><br/>

In order to create a risk-adjusted backlog, the project team must determine the business value of completing each user story as well as the business value of addressing each project risk. Once a value has been associated with the delivery of each user story and addressing each risk, the project team can compare them and determine the priority for each activity. Depending on the value, it may be of greater business benefit to address a particular risk than it would be to implement one of the user stories that deliver product features. In this question, the team has determined the value of each user story but needs to 'monetize' or determine the value of addressing each risk. Calculating the Expected Monetary Value (EMV) for each risk identified allows the project team to then prioritize one activity over another.<br/>

For example, if a risk is estimated to have a 70% probability of occurring and its financial impact on the project would be $10,000, its EMV can be calculated by multiplying the probability by the impact or 0.70 x $10,000 = $7,000. If a user story is only expected to provide $5,000 of business benefit, then it makes more sense to address the risk.<br/>The internal rate of return is a measure of the discount rate at which a project's revenues equal a project's costs. The calculation of IRR is normally associated with project selection and is not used to determine the business value of addressing project risks.<br/>Net present value is a measure of how much money an investment, such as the money invested in a project, can be expected to return in the future based on today’s present value. NPV is not typically used to determine the business value of addressing project risks.<br/>Calculation of expected monetary value is a common approach used to determine the value of addressing an identified risk to the project. EMV uses the probability of the risk occurring and the impact of that risk to determine the business value of addressing the risk.<br/></p></div></div></div></div><br/>

It also describes the mechanisms that should be in place to measure those benefits. For example, on projects conducted using an agile project management approach, the benefits could be realized as the project progresses. This is possible because on agile projects, the product is typically developed incrementally and is delivered with each consecutive iteration, thus providing value to the customer and a revenue stream (realized benefits) to the organization. A properly prepared benefits management plan describes the key elements of the benefits, including how well the project benefits align with the business strategies of the organization.

Experienced agile teams are self-organizing and empowered to make decisions related to their work. Rather than selecting and sequencing work, the project manager explains higher-level objectives to the team, and the team members are empowered to self-organize specific tasks as a group to best meet those objectives. The team in the scenario is not yet knowledgeable in agile practices. Therefore, before reaching this empowered team state, the team members need guidance from an experienced agile practitioner, such as the agile coach. It is also possible, at this stage, that work is assigned to the team members by the project manager. Iteration retrospectives are used to review the process the team uses to complete their tasks and determine what works well and what could be improved. The use of iterations supports such continuous improvement, allowing the team to improve their agile practices from iteration to iteration and, eventually, acquire the skills required to perform without coaching.<br/>The daily standup is a meeting used by the team to report on work done since the previous daily standup, work planned for today, and any impediments to progress. These meetings provide little information as to the ability of the team to perform without coaching.<br/>Product demonstrations, which in agile are called iteration reviews, are meetings used by the team to demonstrate the product increment developed during the recent iteration. These meetings are focused on the product, while the question is concerned with the team, asking if the team is capable to perform without coaching.<br/> Iteration retrospectives are used by teams to review their work process and improve. In the scenario, the agile coach guides the team through their first iterations, including the retrospectives. The retrospectives will allow the coach and team to determine if the team is mature enough in their agile practices to perform without further coaching.<br/></p></div></div></div></div><br/>

Based on the scenario described, it can be reasonably assumed that the change has passed through all the necessary steps, and the decision to reject has been made based on the best judgment of all involved parties. Once the decision is made, all project work should abide by that decision. Trying to persuade the CCB to revert their decision would not be the best use of time of the project manager, the CCB members, or the stakeholder. Therefore, among the choices given, re-communicating the decision of the CCB to the stakeholder and stating that the decision is final would be the best course of action for the project manager to take in this situation even though the project manager supports the change.<br/>The change control board did not approve the change.

The lessons learned repository is one of the organizational process assets that can be used as an input to this process. According to the scenario, most of the project management processes have been properly performed on all of the past projects, suggesting past projects have been lead using the predictive project management approach. When such an approach is used, quality activities are typically performed toward the end of the project. Therefore, quality issues are likely to be detected late in the project life cycle. One way to detect quality issues early is to incorporate some agile practices into the quality processes. Incorporating agile methods into a traditionally managed project will result in the hybrid project management approach. For example, holding recurring retrospectives may help check the effectiveness of the quality processes, look for the root cause of the issues, and then suggest new approaches to improve quality. Retrospectives are typically associated with iterations. While the scenario does not specify whether or not the product will be developed iteratively, of the choices provided, holding recurring retrospectives is the best answer to the question asked.<br/>Estimating costs more accurately may help with better planning of the project budget. However, it is unclear if this action would help detect quality issues earlier in the project life cycle, as requested by the scenario.<br/>The scope is typically validated when a deliverable is completed. It is unlikely that the project will produce deliverables on a daily basis, warranting daily scope validation. Even if this is possible, quality should be checked first before the deliverable can be validated. What good does validating the scope do if the quality is not met?<br/> Recurring retrospectives is an agile/hybrid practice that reflects on work performed, evaluates the processes, and suggests any improvements. By conducting recurring retrospectives, quality issues can be detected earlier in the project life cycle comparing to the traditional methods where quality is checked toward the end of the project.<br/></p></div></div></div></div><br/>

The existence of the product owner suggests the project has agile elements. The project is characterized by a high rate of changes, and it is reasonable to assume that the vast majority of these changes are necessary, as the product owner keeps approving them. However, the project is behind schedule due to the CCB being unable to process the changes timely. It seems as there is a conflict in the way the changes are handled on the project: the product owner approves the changes, but the changes still go to the CCB for further review. The predictive model is not well-suited to projects with a high rate of changes as the formal change control process seeks to limit all but the most important changes. In this case, incorporating some agile best practices will allow the product to evolve as needed without a burdensome change control process. By having the project team work directly with the product owner, the high rate of change can be managed more efficiently and effectively. Note that bypassing the change control process would require an approved change request to modify the change management plan and likely other elements of the project management plan. Therefore, the project manager should first seek approval to make this change.<br/>Due to the high rate of change, incorporating agile methodologies might prove beneficial for this project. However, terminating the project is an extreme action, which is only warranted when there is a high chance that the project cannot meet its objectives. In the scenario, the project is behind schedule, which is not an uncommon situation.<br/>While the project schedule will have to be updated to reflect the delays, the project schedule (unlike the schedule baseline) is a project document. Unless stated otherwise in the scenario, project documents do not require an approved change request to be modified.<br/>The core problem in this scenario is that the high rate of changes combined with a formal change control process is causing the project to run behind schedule. Incorporating some agile practices within the existing framework will allow the product to evolve unencumbered.<br/></p></div></div></div></div><br/>

This model is typically referred to by project management practitioners as part of the Develop Team process. The model includes five stages: forming, storming, norming, performing, and adjourning. While it is safe to say that most teams go through all five stages, some may get stuck in a particular stage or even regress (go back) to an earlier stage. On the other hand, projects with team members who worked together in the past might skip a stage. Each stage is distinguished by different dynamics among the team members resulting in various levels of team effectiveness. Team effectiveness is at its lowest level during the storming stage as the environment is characterized by a high degree of conflict and a lack of collaboration among the team members. As the team members begin to work together and trust each other, in other words, the relationships between the team members normalize (thus the name of the next stage, norming), the degree of team effectiveness increases. Teams that successfully go through the norming stage would eventually reach the performing stage, which is the highest level of team development. In the performing stage, the team function as a well-organized unit, and the team effectiveness is at its highest.<br/>

The role of a project manager (or scrum master, agile coach, servant leader, facilitator, etc.) is also different during different team development stages. In the forming stage, the project leader should set goals, provide direction, and help establish ground rules. During the storming stage, which is typically the most difficult one, the project leader should facilitate conversations between the team members, ensure that the team members listen to and respect each other, and help resolve conflicts. The norming stage allows the project leader to loosen their grip, let the team resolve issues and conflicts, and step in as needed to ensure the team keeps moving in the right direction. When the team reaches the performing stage, the project leader typically acts as an observer stepping in only when a decision needs to be made at a higher level within the organization. And finally, during the adjourning stage, which coincides with the end of the project, a good project leader ensures the team is recognized for their achievement in project completion, the success is celebrated, and lessons learned are captured.<br/> Area A represents the forming phase of the team development model. In this phase, the team members meet and learn about the project and their formal roles and responsibilities. Team members tend to be independent and not as open. The scenario describes a team working as a well-organized unit, making this choice an incorrect answer.<br/>Area B represents the storming phase of team development. During this phase, the team begins to address the project work, technical decisions, and the project management approach. If team members are not collaborative, the environment can become counterproductive, resulting in low team effectiveness. This description does not match the one provided in the scenario.<br/>Area C represents the norming stage of the team development model. In this phase, team members begin to work together and adjust their work habits and behavior to support the team. The team members learn to trust each other. In the scenario, the team has reached a more advanced stage in their development.<br/></p></div></div></div></div><br/>

Reciprocal commitment refers to an agile development team who commits to delivering 100% of the specified functionality according to the definition of done at the end of the sprint, and the product owner, the organization, the stakeholders, and the customer who agrees not to add new scope/user stories or change priorities during the sprint. Although reciprocal commitment is an important agile principle, it is by no means absolute. The product owner is ultimately accountable for the sprint backlog and what should be included in the current sprint. Therefore, the best course of action for the project manager to take is to contact the product owner and ask if the user stories are still a priority. The product owner may do one of the following, for example:
Replace the user stories with other user stories in the current sprint backlog. This should be done in coordination with the development team;
Apply even higher priority to any user stories affected by this technology in order to get as much value from the market as possible before the new technology is released;
Cancel the current sprint and start a new sprint with a re-prioritized set of user stories. This is an extreme, but possible scenario.<br/> Although the input of the sponsor is very valuable, the responsibility of the product backlog lies with the product owner, not the sponsor or project manager. Removing the user stories from the backlog would be overstepping the authority the project manager has on an agile project.<br/>The team does have a commitment to complete the user stories to achieve the originally established sprint goals. However, agile teams have to be adaptive to change, especially when the change might affect their work. Ignoring the sponsor's input does not sound like the best course of action.<br/>The product owner is ultimately responsible for the direction of the product. The product owner, in collaboration with the team, establishes the sprint backlog and determines the priority of its user stories. Therefore, of the choices provided, contacting the product owner and asking if the user stories are still a priority is the best course of action.<br/></p></div></div></div></div><br/>

Constraint driven delivery is a common strategy for agile projects, where the cost and/or time are fixed, and the scope is allowed to vary. Such projects will require greater flexibility and a more collaborative relationship with vendors as compared to a traditional waterfall approach. The correct answer choices represent tactics that support the need for collaboration and provide greater flexibility. The incorrect answer choices are indicative of strategies that are better suited to a predictive model and unlikely to be used for an agile project.<br/>When using an agile approach, the product scope will be progressively elaborated rather than planned in advance. Therefore, a detailed work breakdown structure (WBS) is unlikely to be produced during initial project planning.<br/> Agile methodologies are dependant upon a collaborative approach with project stakeholders and vendors. This collaborative approach can be supported by ensuring that both sides share in the risks and rewards associated with the project.<br/>When using agile methodologies, the entire project scope may not be known upfront. One solution is to contract for micro-deliverables such as user stories, which provides much greater flexibility and better supports the evolution of the product scope throughout the project.<br/></p></div></div></div></div><br/>

In other words, the objective of the project is to build a website used to manage knowledge. The overarching issue in any knowledge management solution (physical or electronic) is the segregation of information based on the need to know and legal restrictions. Therefore, confidentiality will be a major concern with the website under development. Although there may be requirements for handling peak loads that could be caused by flu outbreaks and other requirements for the system, these other requirements are not critical to the system design. Therefore, ensuring the confidentiality of personal data will be the highest priority.<br/>COVID-19 outbreaks may increase the number of users on the system, simulating a system load test. But a load test based on the volume of potential users during the outbreak would create is a secondary concern to another more essential part of the system.<br/>The system design isn't dependent on the knowledge that the families possess. The system is being created to help fill in gaps in parent's knowledge, so discoveries or trends can be identified. Therefore, a parent’s knowledge of problems that exist is not a major influencer of system design, but this knowledge is exactly the type of data that would populate the system, once built.<br/>This system will contain personal data that needs to be protected.

Wide bands mean that there is a blockage in the flow. Items accumulate as they don't move onto the next step. Narrow bands mean that either work in progress (WIP) of that step is too small or the team is unable to process the items in that step fast enough. In this diagram, the widest band at this point in time (Day 8) is the Development, which is feeding into a narrow band, Testing. It can be inferred from the diagram and is reasonable to assume that either those responsible for testing have challenges with their tasks, or the WIP of the testing column is too low. Hence, many development items are pending in the Development stage before they can be pulled out by the testers into the Testing stage.

One of them is the way key stakeholders are involved. In predictive projects, key stakeholders are typically involved at specific milestones, such as the project kick-off meeting, phase gates, transition from project to operations, and other major milestones. At the other end of the project life cycle continuum are agile projects, in which stakeholder involvement is continuous. This means the stakeholders are involved in planning, on-going review and feedback on the product increments, the performance of the project team, and even daily standup meetings, when and if necessary. Hybrid projects, depending on their proximity to predictive or agile approaches, will have their stakeholders involved more frequently than just at specific milestones (as with the predictive projects), but less frequently than what would have been described as a continuous involvement (as with the agile projects). For example, unlike with predictive projects, stakeholders on hybrid projects can be involved at milestones and, in addition, during planing, review, and delivery of the product subsets, which is the delivery approach typical for hybrid projects. On the other hand, stakeholder involvement on hybrid projects would be less frequent than constant involvement in agile projects where key stakeholders continuously have their fingers on the pulse of the project.<br/>

One may argue that ""regularly"" is a subset of ""continuously"", making the two choices plausible answers. While this is true, as far as the exam is concerned, we always have to select the 'best' answer to the question asked. Of the two choices, in the context of the scenario that describes a hybrid project, ""regularly"" means less frequently than ""continuously"" (which is a characteristic of an agile project), and therefore, represents a better answer choice.<br/>Continuous involvement of key project stakeholders is one of the main characteristics of agile projects. The stakeholders are involved in planning, on-going review and feedback on the product increments, and the performance of the project team. Another answer choice better describes the involvement of key stakeholders in hybrid projects.<br/>It is the predictive rather than hybrid projects where the key stakeholders are involved at specific milestones, such as the project kick-off meeting, phase gates, transition from project to operations, and other major milestones. On hybrid projects, like the one described in the scenario, key stakeholders are involved more frequently.<br/>Unlike predictive projects where stakeholders are involved at specific milestones or agile projects where stakeholder involvement is continuous, hybrid projects, like the one described in the scenario, take a combined approach, involving stakeholders regularly. This means more often than only at specific milestones as with predictive projects, but not continuously as on agile projects.<br/></p></div></div></div></div><br/>

Such a project environment is best addressed using the combination of agile and predictive methodologies. As far as project scheduling is concerned, applying iterative schedule with a backlog to develop the product is a common agile practice. The requirements are documented in user stories that are then prioritized and refined just prior to their development, and the product features are built using time-boxed periods of work, typically called iterations. This approach is often used to frequently deliver incremental value to the customer, which is what was required by the project sponsor in the question. Adaptive methodologies are better suited to projects with frequently changing project requirements, such as in the scenario described. When using an adaptive life cycle, the time-boxed periods for releases, waves, and iterations are specified. Time-boxed periods are durations during which the team works steadily toward the completion of a goal. Therefore, of the choices provided, using time-boxing to address frequent changes and delivering value to the customer would help the most, making time-boxing the best answer to the question asked.<br/>

Note, agile projects typically have a fixed budget. Therefore, when functional product increments are delivered frequently, the risk the project budget will be exceeded is low. The reason being is that when the project runs out of budget, the project can be terminated at any given moment, but the customer will still have the latest functioning product increment delivered in the most recent iteration. This is the most likely reason the sponsor indicated that the cost baseline should be kept under strict control.<br/>Time-boxing is an effective tool that can be used on projects where requirements are anticipated to change frequently. This approach is used on agile projects where the requirements are documented in user stories that are prioritized and refined just before being developed, and the product features are delivered using time-boxed periods of work.<br/>Integrated change control addresses scope creep.

Project size and complexity have a direct impact on overall project risk. A large and complex project requires a more robust risk management plan and a more detailed risk register to address the increased level of overall project risk. The outcomes of these tailoring decisions are recorded in the risk management plan. Using the risk management plan and risk register from a previous project as a template for a larger and more complex project without tailoring would likely result in the realization of risks without adequate response plans, which may jeopardize the project's objectives. Therefore, of the available choices, the lack of tailoring of the risk management plan is what most likely caused the project to be terminated before completion.<br/>The use of templates is a project management best practice to save time and effort. Templates might be found as part of the organizational process assets or derived from past similar projects. While using templates is an excellent idea, the templates used for risk management must be tailored to the size and complexity of the project.<br/>The question states that the high-impact risks that were encountered by the project were unexpected, which suggests that these risks were not previously identified. Any potential risk responses, which were planned & agreed-upon, were not applicable, as they pertained to other risks.<br/> Project size and complexity have a direct impact on overall project risk.

In flow-based agile, the team pulls features from the backlog based on its capacity to start work rather than on an iteration-based schedule. Iteration-based teams typically use task boards to reflect the work to be completed in an iteration. The team defines its workflow with columns on a task board and manages the work in progress for each column. A task board makes these tasks highly visible so that everyone can see which tasks are currently being worked on versus which tasks are available for selection.<br/>A burndown chart is a visual representation of the project’s progress over time. It accomplishes this by displaying the actual amount of work remaining in the project, which will 'burn down' over time.

Reporting a cost variance to the penny implies a level of precision that is not realistic, as the project's cost variance is constantly changing. Additionally, although the money spent might be obtained for any point in a project, the earned value needed to calculate the cost variance is more subjective. Therefore, providing a cost variance to the penny implies a level of precision that is not obtainable. In this case, it would be more appropriate to report the cost variance as $25,000.<br/>

As an analogy, imagine if a scientist stated that a particular dinosaur bone was 100,000,127 years old. However, the test used to determine the age may only be accurate to a few million years.

In the scenario described, the development team's productivity is suffering because of constant requests for information coming from the stakeholder as well as the stakeholder's intrusive questions forcing the team to defend how they do their work. Therefore, it may be necessary to isolate the development team from these distractions. This can be done by implementing a ground rule that specifies that all requests for information from the developers should come through the scrum master and not directly to the development team. This approach is a common agile practice.<br/>The scrum master, as a servant leader, must protect the development team from distractions that may negatively affect productivity. Removing impediments and roadblocks that interfere with the team's progress is a generic answer. In the scenario described, this means requiring the stakeholder to direct inquiries to the scrum master.<br/>Collaborating with stakeholders is one of the fundamental principles of agile teams. The scenario does not explicitly state that the stakeholder was the main reason for the team's productive drop. However, the scenario implies the stakeholder has something to do with the drop. Therefore, before encouraging the team to interact with and address the needs of the stakeholder, analyzing the situation and making an informed decision would be a better course of action for the scrum master.<br/>It would be appropriate to talk to the stakeholder and set expectations as to how the interactions with the team should be carried out. However, isolating the team from 'any' outside influence is an over-reaction and runs against the general agile principles of collaboration, shared participation, and customer involvement. While some 'defense' mechanisms should be in place to allow the team to work effectively, those mechanisms have to be reasonable rather than isolating the team entirely from the outside world.<br/></p></div></div></div></div><br/>

The team members think these features are interesting and useful for the customer. This practice is known as gold plating. The question also states that the project has a work breakdown structure (WBS) and baselines, which implies that a traditional waterfall framework is being employed for this project. A daily standup meeting is a common ceremony used on agile projects, but can also be incorporated into a predictive model. One of the objectives of a daily standup meeting is for each team member to identify what they plan to accomplish during the next 24-hour period. If the project manager can gain an understanding of the work planned for the day, they can address any deviations from the planned work beforehand. Of the available answer choices, instituting a daily standup meeting has the best probability of eliminating, or at least reducing, the gold plating.<br/>With agile methodologies, the features to be developed are captured in the product backlog, which is managed by the product owner. The development team is not likely to have the authority to develop any features they deem of value. Gold plating should be avoided regardless of the project management framework used.<br/>The issue of gold plating should be captured in the issue log. However, the issue log is a project document. Unless stated otherwise in the scenario, project documents do not require an approved change request to be revised.<br/>The issue of gold plating should be discussed during the project retrospective, and any knowledge gained should then be recorded in the lessons learned register. However, the project retrospective occurs at the end of the project, which will be too late to prevent gold plating with the current project.<br/></p></div></div></div></div><br/>

However, in reality, this is not always possible. In the scenario described, the internal project team is comprised of generalizing specialists who suggest to carry out the work iteratively, i.e., using agile practices. However, the vendor refuses. There is not enough information in the scenario to determine if the organization can force the vendor to adopt agile methods for the duration of the project. The team, being a self-organizing unit, is empowered to make decisions related to its work and, therefore, decides that at least their portion of the project work will be carried out using agile. When two different project management approaches are combined (either voluntarily or out of necessity), the best approach to take in this situation is to manage the project as a hybrid.<br/> A self-organizing team comprised of generalizing specialists is a characteristic of an agile project management approach. Since the vendor refuses to cooperate, and only software will be developed iteratively, taking a hybrid project management approach is the only available choice in the circumstances described.<br/>In the waterfall project management approach (also known as predictive or traditional) the requirements are typically well-known upfront, the plans are developed early in the project life cycle, the work is executed according to the plan, and the project is closed after the deliverables are produced, tested, and accepted. In the scenario, however, at least the software portion of the product will be developed iteratively, implying the overall project management approach is not a waterfall.<br/>An agile project management approach advocates for iterative and/or incremental product development. However, since the vendor refuses to cooperate with the team to work in an iterative manner, the overall project management approach cannot be agile.<br/></p></div></div></div></div><br/>

However, it is better for a project to fail sooner rather than later. As it pertains to risk mitigation, agile teams prefer to fail fast to detect and correct potential problems as early in the project life-cycle as possible. By failing fast, the team will have an opportunity to learn early. Not only the team, but the whole organization can benefit from the fast failure, because if the team cannot eventually overcome the risks and challenges, then the organization can consider project termination and reallocation of the organizational resources.<br/>Velocity is the number of story points an agile team completes in a predefined period of time, e.g., an iteration. Trying to achieve the fastest velocity is a noble goal. However, this course of action would not ensure that project risks are exposed and addressed early in the project, which is what the project manager is trying to accomplish.<br/>If a project was doomed to fail, then a company should not have undertaken it in the first place. Doing everything to ensure that the project is terminated as fast as possible makes little to no sense<br/>Features that are estimated to have the biggest number of story points are not necessarily the most complicated or risky work items. Therefore, developing those features would not necessarily result in failure.<br/></p></div></div></div></div><br/>

In such projects, the risk management plan specifies, among other things, the timing of when and how often the Project Risk Management processes will be performed throughout the project life cycle, and establishes risk management activities for inclusion into the project schedule. According to the scenario, the team feels that conducting the Perform Qualitative Risk Analysis process once during project planning and then during project execution, each time a major risk is identified, is not aligned with the iterative nature of the product being developed. This implies that the product is likely being developed in iterations suggesting an agile nature of the product development activities. In an agile development environment, the Perform Qualitative Risk Analysis process is conducted before the start of each iteration. This is done to address the inherent uncertainty and risk typical for such environments. The predictive project management approach described in the scenario and the incorporation of iterative development makes the project hybrid. In hybrid settings, practices from various project management methods are often combined and tailored to address the specific needs of the project. Therefore, of the choices provided, conducting the Perform Qualitative Risk Analysis process before the start of each iteration is the best answer to the question asked.<br/>The essence of the question lies with the risk management approach as it relates to the iterative nature of the product rather than the severity of the risks.

The iterative nature of the product being developed and the specifications in the risk management plan imply that the Perform Qualitative Risk Analysis process can be more efficient if conducted before the start of each iteration.<br/>It does not seem/sound reasonable that the nature of the product can be changed at will be simply submitting a change request.

Overall project risk is the effect of uncertainty on the project as a whole. Many various factors contribute to the overall project risk: technical, managerial, commercial, external, to name but a few. Deliverables are not produced up until the project enters its execution. Project objectives, such as scope, schedule, cost, quality, etc. are not being measured during project initiation and planning. At that point, there are many unknowns, and it's even unclear if the project will meet its objectives. Therefore, the overall project risk at the beginning of the project is the greatest. As the project progresses, decisions are made, and deliverables and produced and accepted the overall project risk decreases. During project closure, there are typically not too many unknowns left (if at all). After the deliverables are accepted, and the project's objectives are met, the ""victory"" can be declared. This is where the overall project risk is considered very low or non-existent. Therefore, of the choices provided, the risk is considered the greatest during project initiation (area A).<br/>Area A represents project initiation. On traditionally managed projects, project initiation is characterized by the biggest number of unknowns from various categories: technical, managerial, commercial, external, to name but a few. Therefore, overall project risk is greatest at the start of the project.<br/>Area B represents project planning. On traditionally managed projects, project planning typically involves the development of the project management plan. No deliverables are produced during project planning. However, more is known about the project, and some decisions are made. Hence, the level of risk is not the greatest.<br/>Area C represents activities associated with project execution as well as monitoring and controlling. The focus of the project during this stage of its life cycle is to produce the deliverables. As deliverables are completed and accepted, decisions are made, and uncertainty is left behind, the level of project risk decreases.<br/></p></div></div></div></div><br/>

The main difference between the story map and the roadmap is that the product roadmap organizes the features placed on the story map in releases, which allows the stakeholders to see what features will be delivered in each release. A user story map does not have information about releases and milestones. It is a useful way to discuss the features. Think of a story map as a visual representation of the product backlog, which can be used as an input to release planning. The incorrect answer choices are not visual tools described in the question.<br/>

User story mapping involves ordering user stories along two independent dimensions. The ""map"" arranges user activities along the horizontal axis in rough order of priority. Down the vertical axis, the map represents the increasing sophistication of the implementation. Given a story map so arranged, the first horizontal row represents a ""walking skeleton"", a barebones but usable version of the product. Working through successive rows fleshes out the product with additional functionality.<br/> User story mapping is a visual practice for organizing work into a useful model to help understand the sets of high-value features to be created over time, identify omissions in the backlog, and effectively plan releases that deliver value to users. This choice most accurately describes the scenario provided and is, therefore, the best answer to the question asked.<br/> A product backlog is not a tool. It's an ordered list of user-centric requirements that a team maintains for a product. Besides, one of the capabilities the meeting participants are looking in the tool is its ability to identify omissions in the backlog. Using a backlog to identify omissions in the backlog does not make sense.<br/>The work breakdown structure (WBS) is a hierarchical decomposition of the total scope of work to be carried out by the project team to accomplish the project objectives and create the required deliverables. The WBS does not have the virtues that the meeting participants are looking for.<br/></p></div></div></div></div><br/>

A phase gate is a review at the end of a phase in which a decision is made to continue to the next phase, to continue with modification, or to end a project.

</div></div> </div></div></div><div class='answer'><a class='ans' onclick='showHide(510)'>Ans</a><p style='display:none;' id='ans_510'>2--The scenario suggests that a hybrid lifecycle is being employed with the use of baselines combined with sprints. When applying the schedule performance index (SPI) to sprints, the SPI can be calculated as the story points completed divided by the story points associated with the sprint goal. The team has been completing 50 story points per sprint with a goal of 60 points for an SPI of 0.83. The goal of 60 story points can be calculated using simple math, i.e., if 50 / X = 0.83, then X = 50 / 0.83 = 60 (rounded). When using Scrum (as is suggested with the use of sprints), the team commits during sprint planning to the number of story points to be completed in the upcoming sprint. Despite falling short of their sprint goals, the project is still on schedule. Since the team has established a stable velocity of 50 story points per sprint, it is unrealistic to keep committing to completing 60 points, especially in light of the fact that the team's current velocity has kept the project on schedule. Although it would not be appropriate for the project manager to direct the team to lower their sprint goal, the project manager should provide guidance that the sprint goal of 60 points might not be realistic based on the team's velocity of 50 points per sprint.<br/>

Note, the fact the project is trending to meet all of the baselines but the SPI is 0.83 might seem to contradict. In reality, it does not. All it means is that the team likely over-committed by planning 60 story points per sprint. Therefore, if the team indeed completed 60 points per sprint, the project would have been ahead of schedule. In the scenario, the team completed 50 points, so the SPI is less than 1.0, but the project is still on schedule.<br/>

<br/>The scenario states that the project is trending to meet all of the baselines, which would include the schedule baseline. Therefore, there would be no reason to revise the schedule baseline based on the information provided.<br/> It seems as if the team over-committed by planning 60 story points per sprint. Since the team has established a stable velocity of 50 story points per sprint, it is unrealistic to keep committing to completing 60 points, all else being equal.<br/>The question stipulates that the project is trending to meet all of the baselines, which would include the schedule baseline. Crashing the schedule is not warranted and will increase costs, which might jeopardize the cost baseline.<br/></p></div></div></div></div><br/>

This is an example of reciprocal commitment, where the agile development team commits to delivering 100% of the specified functionality according to the definition of done at the end of the sprint, and the product owner, organization, and customer agree not to add new user stories (requirements) or change priorities during the sprint. Additionally, according to the scenario, the project change management plan provides that all changes should pass through the change control board (CCB). This is an example of a hybrid project where some aspects are managed using agile while others using the predictive project management approach.<br/>

Note, reciprocal commitment is an important agile principle. However, it is by no means absolute. This situation may occur in real-life situations. For example, it could be that this new requirement will be considered of higher value to the customer and/or higher risk to the project by the product owner. If so, the product owner has several choices:

The product owner may decide to add the new requirement as a user story in the current sprint backlog. However, this change to the current sprint backlog should not be made without the approval of the development team and the removal of an equivalent amount of work from the current sprint backlog.<br/>
The product owner may also decide to create a user story for this requirement and add it to the top of the product backlog, i.e., give it the highest priority for the inclusion into the next sprint.<br/>
Another option is that if the requirement has significant business or technological implications (such as a compliance issue), the product owner may decide to cancel the current sprint and start a new sprint that includes this new high priority requirement.<br/>It's the product (not sprint) backlog that should be re-prioritized. And, it's the product owner (not the project manager) who should do the re-prioritization. Additionally, since all changes should go via the CCB, as stated in the scenario, a change request will have to be submitted.<br/>According to the scenario, the deliverables are developed using sprints, implying the actual work is carried out using agile practices. While it's true than on agile projects, the product owner is typically the one who defines the scope; there is nothing wrong if a project stakeholder requests a change or new requirement. The scenario mentions CCB as the entity to review and approve changes. The scenario, however, does not suggest that new requirements can only be submitted by the product owner and/or CCB<br/>First, a retrospective is held at the end of the sprint to inspect and adapt the process the team uses to develop product increments, rather than identify reasons why requirements were not identified. Second, not all requirements are typically identified during the Collect Requirements process. Some pop up as the project progresses. This is why there are processes and procedures in place (as per the project management approach selected) to manage changes to the project during its execution.<br/></p></div></div></div></div><br/>

Servant leaders are good listeners. In the situation described, the project manager, as a servant leader, should first listen to what the team members have to say and, without making any immediate and uninformed decisions, absorb the frustration of the team members. Agile servant leaders should not blame or criticize the team for not being able to deal with issues. Rather, they should explain that challenges and difficulties are a common thing for new and complex projects, and suggest ways for how to improve the situation. Ideally, absorbing the frustration of the team members 'and' suggesting a solution would be a better answer choice. However, this option is not provided. Therefore, of the available choices, absorbing the frustration of the team is the best answer to the question asked.<br/>First, there is not enough information in the scenario to determine if a change request is needed and for what. Second, according to the scenario, the project is managed using agile methods. In agile projects, changes are typically addressed by prioritizing the product backlog.<br/>Servant leadership is a pinnacle of agile leaders. Servant leaders motivate and inspire teams. When needed, a servant leader acts as a mom and dad for the team members to absorb the frustration of their ""kids"". Sometimes, a sympathetic ear is all you need to let off your steam.<br/>Escalating the issue to the management right away is a premature action. Agile leaders are expected to resolve issues that are under their control. If the issue cannot be resolved, then the escalation to the management can be considered as the next step.<br/></p></div></div></div></div><br/>

Thus, you, as the project manager need to ensure that costs are brought back into alignment with the cost baseline by the end of the project. Having just performed the variance analysis, you should now seek to isolate and understand the variance in order to ensure the appropriate action is taken. For example, it is possible that the cause of the cost variance is the result of a one-time unexpected expenditure early in the project with recent trend analysis indicating that the project should finish within the cost baseline and no action is necessary.

Note, the project schedule alone does not define 'what' training is needed for a particular team member and 'how' this training should be conducted. However, by analyzing the project schedule and identifying what activities are scheduled, when they are scheduled, and who is assigned to these activities, the project manager can determine in advance what training is required for each project team member, and how this training should be conducted to develop the competencies required at different phases.

The choice of media includes decisions about the application of communications artifacts to meet specific project needs, such as when to communicate in writing versus orally, when to prepare an informal memo versus a formal report, and when to use push/pull options as the choice of appropriate technology. In this case, the project manager should have followed up the phone conversation (informal oral communication) with formal written communication in the form of an updated contract or an addendum to the existing contract instead of relying on informal oral communication. With informal oral communication, there is no record of what agreements were made. Additionally, an oral contract, as suggested by the question, cannot supersede a written contract from a legal standpoint. Therefore, of the available choices, following up the phone conversation with a different choice of media is the best way the issue could have been avoided.<br/>Active listening involves acknowledging, clarifying and confirming understanding, and removing barriers that adversely affect comprehension. The question does not elaborate on the extent to which active listening skills were employed by the project manager. However, there is no indication in the question that there was a misunderstanding between the customer's authorized representative and the project manager. The main problem was the fact that the project manager failed to capture the verbal agreement in the form of a formal written agreement. Therefore, it is unlikely that the lack of active listening skills is what contributed to the problem presented by the question.<br/>The choice of media includes decisions such as when to communicate in writing versus orally. The project manager should have followed up the phone conversation with an updated contract instead of relying on an oral agreement. If the project manager had selected the appropriate choice of media, the issue could have been avoided.<br/>Scope creep is the uncontrolled expansion of product or project scope without adjustments to time, cost, and resources. In this case, the additional scope was requested by the customer, and the change request was approved. Therefore, the added functionality does not represent scope creep. Although declining the request may have prevented the problem which developed later, there is no valid reason presented by the question for the project manager to decline the customer's request, and this is not the best way that the project manager could have avoided the dispute with the customer.<br/></p></div></div></div></div><br/>

At the same time, the project team holds daily standup meetings, which are typical for agile projects. However, holding such meetings is not exclusive for agile projects. Any project, whether waterfall or agile, can benefit from the team that meets daily to discuss work done, work planned, and any impediments to progress. The combination of practices from both traditional and agile projects results in a hybrid project management approach. The main goal of including the project stakeholders in the daily standups is to maintain effective relationships with these individuals and groups. Appropriate communication strategies are vital to maintaining such relationships. Having stakeholders attend the daily standup meetings is an example of this communication strategy. While typically daily standups are held by and for the team members, stakeholders can also be invited, where appropriate. Transparency in communications builds trust between the team and stakeholders and promotes healthy and effective relationships with the stakeholders.<br/>Comparing the work completed vs. planned is typically done as part of the variance analysis. Such an analysis is often time-consuming and usually involves the implementation of various tools and techniques. Daily standup meetings described in the scenario are not an appropriate venue for these activities.<br/>While resolving the issues and impediments encountered by the team can be part of a meeting (sometimes called ""a parking lot"") that is held immediately after the daily standup, the main goal of inviting stakeholders to the daily standup is stakeholder engagement rather than problem-solving.<br/>Stakeholder engagement and project communications are closely related. Effective and open communications between the project team and stakeholders typically nurture effective relationships between all parties involved in the project, thus increasing the chances of a project's success.<br/></p></div></div></div></div><br/>

In order to effectively manage the new stakeholder's level of engagement, the project manager must understand, among other things, the stakeholder's requirements and expectations. Meeting with the stakeholder provides an opportunity for the project manager to establish a relationship and gather the necessary information from the stakeholder to engage her effectively. Therefore, of the available options, the best course of action for the project manager to do is meet with the stakeholder to learn the stakeholder's requirements and expectations for the project. The incorrect answer choices represent actions that may not be necessary, or the project manager does not have enough information to perform at this point.<br/>The stakeholder engagement assessment matrix is a matrix that compares current and desired stakeholder engagement levels. This information is not known until the project manager has an opportunity to make an assessment of the stakeholder's engagement level.<br/>It is likely that the stakeholder engagement plan will eventually need to be updated to engage the new stakeholder. However, to do so, the project manager will have to learn first about the new stakeholder's requirements and expectations as described by the scenario. This information can be obtained using various approaches. Meeting with the stakeholder is one of them.<br/>A RACI chart is a type of responsibility assignment matrix (RAM) that uses responsible, accountable, consult, and inform status to define the involvement of stakeholders in project activities. At this point, the only information available about the new stakeholder is that they have influence and will be responsible for a few aspects of the project. The level of influence is not part of the RACI chart. Without knowing the exact responsibilities of the stakeholder, updating the RACI chart is a premature action.<br/></p></div></div></div></div><br/>

</div></div> </div></div></div><div class='answer'><a class='ans' onclick='showHide(526)'>Ans</a><p style='display:none;' id='ans_526'>2--On any project, a classic struggle exists between the risk and value associated with a feature. The solution is to give neither risk nor value total supremacy when prioritizing. Considering both risk and value is essential to prioritize work optimally. The high-value / high-risk features should be developed first. These features deliver the most value, and working on them eliminates significant risk. As a general rule concerning risk and value, agile practitioners should use the guideline to work first on high-value features but use risk as a tie-breaker. Another point to keep in mind is that a feature's risk and value profile will most likely change over time and will require constant monitoring and possible re-prioritization.<br/> Low-risk / high-value features bear the same high value as high-risk / high-value features. However, developing the low-risk / high-value features first means postponing the development of high-risk / high-value features. If risks associated with the high-risk / high-value features realizes later in the project, the chances of properly addressing those risks reduce, thus decreasing the probability of project success.<br/>High-risk / high-value features should be developed first. These features deliver the most value, and working on them eliminates significant risk or allows sufficient time to address the risk if one arises.<br/>Low-risk / low-value features should be developed after the high-risk / high-value features, and low-risk / high-value features have been developed. Low-risk / low-value features will have less impact on the total value of the product if they are dropped. Additionally, developing these features late in the project poses a low risk.<br/></p></div></div></div></div><br/>

During this stage, the team members are still learning their role within the team and how to collaborate with one another. In this scenario, the project team is in the forming stage and may not be capable of self-management at the onset of the project. The agile coach may need to adopt a more directive leadership style for the first sprint or two and then transition to a more supportive leadership approach once the team begins to coalesce.<br/>Ideally, agile teams are self-managing. However, a newly formed team may not be capable of effective self-management in the beginning. Additionally, ignoring any problem with the project or project team is not likely to be the correct answer. At a minimum, the agile coach should monitor the situation to determine what action to take, if any.<br/>The agile coach may need to assign tasks to individual team members while the team is in the forming stage. However, as the team develops and collaboration improves, the coach should transition from directive to a supportive leadership style. Thus, assigning the user stories to individual team members from now onward is an overreaction.<br/>The project team may or may not benefit from updating the team charter in this situation. However, the team charter will be most effective when it is developed by the project team members, or when they are at least given the opportunity to contribute to it.

</div></div> </div></div></div><div class='answer'><a class='ans' onclick='showHide(528)'>Ans</a><p style='display:none;' id='ans_528'>4--In agile projects, work to be completed is represented by the user stories. User stories comprise the product/release/iteration backlog. The way the backlog is prioritized depends on various factors. Customer value is typically the most important one. However, along with customer value, risk should also be considered. The scenario does not provide sufficient details as to whether or not the backlog was prioritized properly. However, based on the way the scenario is framed, one can imply that the high-risk user stories were prioritized low in the backlog because they were of low value to the customer. When planning risk-related work, it is better to address high-risk items sooner rather than later, so that if the risk is realized, there will be sufficient time to address the event and to help minimize the impact on the iteration or release. Therefore, of the choices provided, scheduling the completion of the high-risk user stories in the product backlog sooner rather than later in the release cycle would have likely helped avoid the situation described in the scenario.<br/>Adding resources and authorizing overtime may (or may not) help in speeding up the development. This course of action, however, is unlikely to resolve risk-related issues that occur later in the project. This approach is also counter to agile best practices.<br/>The risk exists more due to the nature of the work than how that work is described in a user story. It would be hard to impossible to eliminate risk based solely on how the work needed to be completed is described in the user story.<br/>It is always possible to influence the probability and impact of identified risk events. An agile best practice is to address the high-risk user stories earlier in the project. Discovering problems sooner rather than later allows more time to address and resolve these problems.<br/></p></div></div></div></div><br/>

Ideally, agile teams are comprised of generalized specialists, meaning the team members are cross-functional who have both a focused specialty plus a breadth of experience across multiple skills, instead of subject matter experts as often acceptable in traditionally managed projects. As such, the project team can move as necessary between the tasks and form self-organizing units freely and fluidly as the project demands. The project manager takes a more supportive role and works to remove roadblocks and empower the team.<br/>In agile projects where the team members are highly capable and knowledgeable, the role of the project manager does not require them to direct and instruct the team members. The team members are empowered to make their own choices and direction without a need to rely on the project manager's leadership and assignments.<br/>Teams comprised of specialists can primarily only perform the tasks they are trained for. As such, this does not enable them to freely move between tasks and be self-organizing.<br/>Self-organizing teams are successful when the team members have broad skills and understanding of the project activities enabling them to effectively move between tasks and project needs.<br/></p></div></div></div></div><br/>

In this scenario, the construction manager noticed that there was too much levity and was concerned that the demolition team was not being serious enough about safety. The construction manager recognized that the hazardous attitude being displayed by the demolition team represented a trigger condition, which prompted the risk response of calling in the safety manager to discuss safety protocols with the team.

Mentoring stakeholders may occur as part of project execution. Of the available options, only Manage Communications and Manage Stakeholder Engagement are included among the execution processes, and mentoring is associated with both of these processes. Mentoring is one example of a communication technique that might be used in support of the Manage Communications process. Additionally, mentoring might be used as a technique to develop the project team members as part of the Develop Team process. Team members are considered project stakeholders. The scenario does not specify if any of the new stakeholders are part of the project team. However, this information is not required to answer the question correctly. In general, since project team members are considered project stakeholders, it is possible that one or more of the mentees are part of the project team. The incorrect answer choices represent project management processes that are not part of project execution and do not typically employ mentoring as a technique.<br/>The project charter is developed during project initiation. According to the scenario, the project is in execution. Therefore, assuming all project management processes have been properly implemented, the project charter should have already been created earlier in the project life cycle.<br/>The communications management plan is created as part of the Plan Communications Management process, which is part of project planning.

According to the references provided, the Definition of Done (DoD) is a team's checklist of all the criteria required to be met so that a deliverable can be considered ready for customer use. The DoD for a product increment to be developed by the agile team is created by the team members at the beginning of each sprint. If the team fails to meet these criteria, their work would not count towards the velocity of the current sprint and would most likely be rejected. According to The Scrum Guide™, ""When a Product Backlog item or an Increment is described as 'Done', everyone must understand what 'Done' means. Although this varies significantly per Scrum Team, members must have a shared understanding of what it means for work to be complete, to ensure transparency. This is the definition of 'Done' for the Scrum Team and is used to assess when work is complete on the product Increment.""<br/>Estimate to complete is the expected cost to finish all the remaining project work. The scenario refers to the criteria specified at the beginning of the sprint that determines if the work will or will not be included in the velocity for the current sprint. These criteria do not include the expected cost to finish all the remaining project work.<br/>The definition of done is a shared understanding of what it means for work to be complete. It is the checklist established by the team members at the beginning of the project or sprint that specifies the criteria required to be met so that a deliverable developed during the project or sprint can be considered ready for the customer use.<br/>The project exit criteria are the conditions, which, if met, would result in the project or phase successful closure or early termination. Those criteria are specified in the project charter and apply to the project as a whole rather than to a specific sprint, particular deliverable, or product increment.<br/></p></div></div></div></div><br/>

Project team assignments, however, are a key output of the Acquire Resources process which is carried out later in the project life cycle, as part of project execution. Project team assignments is a project document that records the team members and their roles and responsibilities for the project. Recording this information can only be done after the team is acquired. Since the project is still in planning, and no information is provided in the scenario as to whether or not pre-assignment took place earlier in the project, it can be assumed that the project team assignments document cannot be created at this point, making it the least likely outcome of the planning meetings described in the scenario. All of the other answer choices are key outputs of the Estimate Activity Resources process and can, therefore, be eliminated.<br/>

If you have selected an incorrect answer, this could be because you may have missed the word 'least' in the last sentence of the question. This could be a frustrating experience. However, it is important to understand that these types of questions may appear on the actual exam. Therefore, carefully reading the question text is an important part of practicing and preparing for the exam<br/>By holding planning meetings to determine the resources needed for the project, the scenario implies that the project manager is performing the Estimate Activity Resources process.

Project team assignments, however, are a key output of the Acquire Resources process. Before team members' roles and responsibilities could be recorded, the team members would have to be acquired first, making this choice the best answer.<br/>It can be inferred that the scenario describes the Estimate Activity Resources process. Basis of estimates is one of the outputs of this process.

The scenario implies the project is set up for failure if resources are unavailable to fulfill the project requirements. By proactively identifying the risk of resources being unavailable, establishing the project exit criteria early in the project, and documenting the criteria in the project charter, the key project stakeholders would be aware of the circumstances. In the event risk realizes, i.e., the resources are not available, the news would not come as a surprise, and the project would not be considered a failure. If the project meets its exit criteria, the project enters the Close Project or Phase process.<br/>The risk report is a project document that is first created as an output of the Identify Risks process and then developed progressively throughout the Project Risk Management processes This document summarizes information on individual project risks and the level of overall project risk. While the risk report could have documented the risk of resource unavailability, it is not the right place to specify the conditions for project termination. Additionally, the risk report is typically not available during project initiation.<br/>The resource management plan establishes the approach for managing project resources. The plan could include information on how best to secure resources for the project; however, developing the plan does not address the essence of the question, which is concerned with communicating the risk of resource unavailability to the project stakeholders. Additionally, the resource management plan is created during project planning, while the scenario describes a project in initiation.<br/>The question is concerned with communicating the potential risk of resource unavailability to the key project stakeholders and ensuring this risk is documented as a condition to project termination. Terminating the project at this point is a premature action.<br/></p></div></div></div></div><br/>
