</div></div> </div></div></div><div class='answer'><a class='ans' onclick='showHide(541)'>Ans</a><p style='display:none;' id='ans_541'>4--The cost variance (CV) is the earned value (EV) less the actual cost (AC). The actual cost is provided as $22,000. Therefore, to calculate the CV, one should obtain the EV. The EV is the budget associated with the authorized work that has been completed. The project manager has to know what work packages have been completed so far and the planned values of these packages. The values of the work packages are represented by the budget allocated for those packages. The cost baseline is the approved version of the time-phased project budget and serves as one of the inputs to the Control Costs process described in the scenario. The cost baseline should specify the cost estimates broken down to the work package level (and even the activity level, if needed). The project schedule, on the other hand, will show what work packages or activities have been completed. Knowing these two elements, the packages/activities that have been completed and their planned values (PVs), the project manager can calculate the EV, and, eventually, the CV as requested by the question.<br/>To calculate the CV, the value of the work completed thus far is needed. The cost management plan is the component of a project management plan that describes how costs will be planned, structured, and controlled. While the cost management plan will provide guidance for the Control Costs process, it does not have the values associated with activities and work packages.<br/>Quality control measurements are the documented results of the activities performed during the Control Quality process. These measurements do not provide information related to the earned value analysis that is required for the calculation of the cost variance as requested by the question.<br/>The budget at completion (BAC) is the sum of all budgets established for the work to be performed. To calculate the CV, the value of the work completed thus far is needed. The BAC does not provide work package level detail.<br/></p></div></div></div></div><br/>

</div></div> </div></div></div><div class='answer'><a class='ans' onclick='showHide(542)'>Ans</a><p style='display:none;' id='ans_542'>4--This question may seem straightforward, but selecting the correct answer may need some consideration. Think of the power and responsibilities of agile teams. Agile teams are self-directing, self-organizing, self-managing, and empowered to make decisions related to the way they work together toward the completion of project goals. The key to answering this question is in its last sentence, ""What should the agile coach do first?"" with the emphasis on the word ""first"". There are similar questions in our exam simulator, and the answers are different. However, we have to remember that there could be virtually an endless number of various combinations of the scenarios and answer choices. Each question should be reviewed in its context. A single word in the scenario or answer choice can lead to a totally different answer. The idea is to always select the best choice of those provided even if that choice does not look like a perfect/ideal answer to you, or if the answer you would prefer to see among the options given is not presented. Under the circumstances described in this particular scenario and with the given set of these particular answer choices, letting the team uphold its own ground rules is what the agile coach should do 'first'. It is best for the team to uphold its own ground rules by stepping in and getting those team members who are carrying on a side conversation on board for the rest of the meeting. If the team fails to self-organize, then the agile coach can remind the team about its ground rules and the team's responsibility to uphold them.<br/>This question deals with team dynamics and the lack of understanding of the importance of the daily standup. Functional managers probably could not address this; neither should they be involved in the first response to the situation.<br/>The scenario does not indicate that the meeting environment is negatively charged or filled with conflict warranting such drastic action.

The stakeholders can see the product increment developed by the team during the latest sprint/iteration and provide feedback. Additional information that can be shared with the stakeholder can include items that have been prioritized the highest, what has made it into the next iteration, and how the team is progressing. Good agile practices encourage the team to display project progress in the form of information radiators, such as burn charts, cumulative flow diagrams, etc. Therefore, suggesting that the stakeholder attends the sprint review meeting is the best course of action for the project manager in this situation.<br/>The goal of the sprint planning meeting is to select work items (user stories) for the upcoming sprint, rather than view the team's progress on the development of the new application, as requested by the stakeholder.

This meeting would not help the stakeholder view the team's progress on the development of the new application.<br/>The daily scrum is typically attended by the members of the development team and an agile leader, such as a coach or scrum master.

The storming stage may be exemplified by a lack of trust between the team members, negatively impacting the team's performance, including a lack of effective knowledge transfer. Establishing an atmosphere of trust is the most important aspect of knowledge management. People cannot be forced to share their acumen or absorb the insights of others. Even the best knowledge management tools and techniques will not be effective if team members are not motivated to share what they know. The team members must establish trust in each other so that they will become motivated to share their knowledge for the benefit of the other team members and the project as a whole.<br/>Performing the Develop Team process with the goal of advancing the development team to the next stage(s) of team development is a good strategy. However, the question stipulates that the team is already in the storming stage, and reverting back to the forming stage would take the team in the wrong direction.<br/>Since the iteration retrospectives are specified in the project management plan, an approved change request would be required to eliminate the requirement. However, the project manager should seek to uncover and address the source of the problem to make the retrospectives productive rather than just eliminating them.<br/>The retrospectives will likely be more productive once the development team has reached the performing stage. However, some beneficial insights might be garnered from the retrospectives even before the team can attain the performing stage.

The appropriate next step for the project manager is to analyze alternative solutions against project constraints to determine the best course of action. Regardless of the solution chosen to address the issue, the project management plan will need to be updated which will require an approved change request. Specifically, the resource management plan will need to be updated to reflect actual experience in acquiring resources for the project, which may include the use of external resources. Additionally, although it is not known from the description in the question, it is possible that other project constraints may be affected by the lack of internal resources necessitating the update of the cost and schedule baselines, which will also require a change request. Therefore, of the available choices, the next step for the project manager in this scenario is to submit a change request.<br/>Acquiring outside contractors is a viable solution to the issue described in the scenario. However, the project manager cannot just go ahead and hire outside contractors. A change request needs to be submitted first to update the resource management plan to reflect actual experience in acquiring resources for the project. The project manager will have to determine the best course of action to resolve the situation. If eventually hiring the outside contractors is determined as the best course of action in that situation, another change request will be required to implement that action. Note, depending on the organization’s change control process, one change request may cover both actions.<br/>The appropriate next step for the project manager is to analyze alternative solutions against project constraints to determine the best course of action.

Therefore, planning is typically done upfront before project execution begins. Changes in traditional projects are discouraged and rigorously managed using a strict change control process. In contrast, agile projects are undertaken in cases where requirements are unclear, changes are expected, and therefore, upfront planning makes little sense and sometimes is even impossible. Instead of fighting the change, as the traditional projects do, agile projects embrace change and welcome it at any point during the project. The Agile Manifesto addresses the change in its values and principles. According to the Agile Manifesto, agile practitioners value ""Responding to change over following a plan"", as well as, ""Welcome changing requirements, even late in development.""<br/>A rigorous change control process would be appropriate for a project that is carried out using the predictive project management approach. The scenario states that you are leading an agile project. In agile projects, changes are welcome. Establishing a rigorous change control process would negatively and unnecessarily impact project progress.<br/>Agile projects are undertaken using time-boxed iterations with scope (user stories) defined by the product owner and documented in the iteration backlog. Implementing all and any changes as they arrive would violate the iterations cadence. The product owner should be consulted as to what changes and when to be implemented.<br/>While this answer choice does not provide specific guidelines as to how to handle changes on this project, of the choices given, it outlines one of the Agile Manifesto principles that states, ""Welcome changing requirement, even late in development"", making this choice the best answer to the question asked.<br/></p></div></div></div></div><br/>

Conflict management, facilitation, and meeting management are all skills which will be essential when conducting a kick-off meeting. While the nominal group technique is an interpersonal and team skill, this technique is typically used during the Collect Requirements process to enhance brainstorming with a voting process to rank the most useful ideas for further brainstorming or prioritization. The kick-off meeting is not intended to rank the most useful ideas for further brainstorming or prioritization. Collecting requirements should have taken place during project planning which, based on the scenario described, has already been completed. The goal of the kick-off meeting is to communicate the objectives of the project, gain the commitment of the stakeholders and the team for the project, and explain the roles and responsibilities of each stakeholder. Therefore, of the choices provided, nominal group technique is least likely to be used during the kick-off meeting and is, therefore, the best answer to the question asked.<br/>Meeting management is taking steps to ensure meetings meet their intended objectives effectively and efficiently. Running the kick-off meeting effectively and efficiently is obviously important and therefore cannot be considered as the least likely skill to be utilized during the kick-off meeting.<br/>Facilitation ensures that there is effective participation, that participants achieve a mutual understanding, that all contributions are considered, and that conclusions or results have full buy-in according to the decision process established for the project. Since this option is likely to be useful during a kick-off meeting, it can be eliminated as a correct response.<br/>Conflict management may be necessary to bring diverse stakeholders into alignment and gain commitment to the project. Therefore, this answer choice can be eliminated as it is not the least likely of the available options to be used.<br/></p></div></div></div></div><br/>

Daily standups are short timeboxed meetings where the project team members report on work done since the last meeting, work planned for today, and any impediments to progress. Impediments are risks and/or issues faced by the project team that might delay project work, or, as in the scenario described, even risk the project schedule baseline. Issues should be documented, assigned, and tracked to ensure a timely resolution. The issue log is a project document where information about issues is recorded and monitored. The use of an issue log should help ensure that the impediments are removed in as timely a manner as possible.<br/>

<br/>The issue log is a project document where problems can be recorded, assigned, and tracked to resolution. The use of an issue log should ensure timely follow up on the items that are tracked.<br/>The daily standup is a timeboxed and narrowly focused meeting where the project team coordinates their daily activities. This meeting would not be the appropriate forum to resolve issues. Moreover, it is unlikely that the project team would be able to resolve the impediments during the meeting.<br/>Documenting issues that arise during a project is a good idea. However, the project management plan is the document that describes 'how' the project will be executed, monitored and controlled, and closed, and, as such, is not the right place to document issues identified throughout the project life cycle. Issues should be recorded in the issue log.<br/></p></div></div></div></div><br/>

While this may sound counter-intuitive, project team members are considered stakeholders. The scenario implies the project manager is carrying out the Develop Team process. Individual and team assessments may be performed as part of this process. Outputs of the process include updates to the enterprise environmental factors (EEFs), including skill assessments. Enterprise environmental factors represent conditions, not under the immediate control of the team, that influence, constrain, or direct the project. This example represents one of the very few instances where the EEFs might be updated as a result of carrying out a project management process.<br/>The resource management plan is a component of the project management plan that describes how project resources are acquired, allocated, monitored, and controlled. The resource management plan might describe 'how' the assessments are performed along with the timing, but would not likely serve as a repository for the skill assessments.<br/>Sharing team assessments with the team at iteration retrospective may be a viable option. However, sharing individual assessments would not be appropriate. Besides, the project is the transformation from waterfall to agile, not the development of a product in iterations.<br/>The scenario implies you are involved in the Develop Team process.

Colocation takes advantage of face-to-face communication, as this represents the richest form of communication and is the most effective. With the project team now being geographically dispersed, face-to-face communication is no longer a viable option for daily communication. Under these circumstances, the project team members are conducting their daily standups via conference calls, which means that they can communicate verbally but will not be able to pick up on nonverbal communication such as body language. The lack of nonverbal communication might lead to misunderstandings and miscommunications, as is the case in the scenario described. One option for the team would be to utilize video conferencing to replicate face-to-face communication in a virtual environment.<br/>One element of nonverbal communication is body language. Body language will be lost when transitioning from face-to-face meetings to a meeting conducted on an audio conference call. A video conference will improve the effectiveness of communication by allowing the participants to read each other's body language.<br/>Face-to-face is the richest form of communication and would be ideal. However, a daily standup is a meeting that is typically conducted daily and timeboxed to 15 minutes. Since the project team is geographically dispersed across the country, bringing the team members together in person every day for a 15-minute meeting would be unrealistic.<br/>The daily standup meeting is a ceremony that is typically associated with agile methodologies. However, agile best practices can be incorporated into an otherwise predictive project management approach. If the daily standup meetings are providing value for the team, there is no reason to discontinue them simply because the project has transitioned to a predictive phase.<br/></p></div></div></div></div><br/>

</div></div> </div></div></div><div class='answer'><a class='ans' onclick='showHide(557)'>Ans</a><p style='display:none;' id='ans_557'>2--The scenario describes a hybrid project combining traditional project management elements, such as the resource management plan and cost baseline with agile methods, such as Scrum, in which the product is developed incrementally over the course of several sprints. The question is really asking about the timing of allocating the funds budgeted for rewards and recognition. Although there is nothing wrong with allocating some of the funds at the start and/or end of the project, it would be best to incorporate rewards and recognition throughout the project. With this strategy, the project manager can reinforce positive behavior during the project to improve performance throughout the project lifecycle. Holding a recognition dinner at the end of each sprint best represents the strategy of using the rewards and recognition throughout the project and is, therefore, the best answer to the question asked.<br/>It would be improper, and likely unethical, to repurpose the funds allocated for recognition and rewards for use as contingency reserves. Budgeted funds should be used for their intended purpose.<br/>Recognition and rewards are most effective when they are applied throughout the project lifecycle. Since scrum development is carried out in sprints, holding a team dinner at the end of each sprint would support this approach.<br/>The number of escaped defects is one of the KPIs that can be used to evaluate team performance. However, first, this approach may lead to a low velocity as team members may spend too much time verifying and re-verifying their software to reduce the number of defects. Second, awarding all the money to one developer would be unfair.<br/></p></div></div></div></div><br/>

While such planning is not easy, the idea is simple: allocating a particular amount of story points to account for ""known-unknowns"", such as bug fixes from previous releases, unexpected calls with the salespeople, work requested by the team members' functional managers, maintenance and support of other products, and so on. The team may consider creating ""dummy"" user stories and calling them, for example, ""bug fixes"", ""sales calls"", ""functional managers' chores"", etc. The team can then roughly estimate each user story based on the experience from previous sprints or projects. These stories and corresponding estimates are then added to the backlogs for the upcoming sprints. This approach is somewhat similar to the risk response planning in traditional projects where contingency reserves are allocated for identified risks.<br/>

As stated by the author in the reference, ""the Team puts Stories in the Sprint Backlog in order to hold (or contain) a budget for the StoryPoints that the Team knows it's going to need to spend on these things. We call these Stories PlaceHolder Stories, as they hold a place in our Sprint Backlog for Stories in a general category that the Team doesn't know the details about yet.""<br/>If an issue log is used on the project, then recording the issues is an appropriate action. However, this course of action does not address the main problem described by the scenario - the project team's inability to meet iteration goals. Updating the issue log is a reactive approach. To be proactive, the teams should plan ahead of time to handle interruptions if eliminating them is not a possibility.<br/>Agile projects do not operate in a vacuum. According to the scenario, the situation is unlikely to change. Therefore, declining 'all' requests is not an option. Rather than declining any work not directly related to the current project and creating unnecessary and sometimes unjustified conflicts, agile teams should plan for these ""known-unknowns"" by allocating a particular amount of story points to account for these tasks in the upcoming sprints.<br/>If the team continues to handle interruptions in the same way as they did in the past, the team would most likely be unable to complete the upcoming sprints for the same reasons they did not complete the previous sprints. There is a better way to address this issue.<br/></p></div></div></div></div><br/>

Therefore, conflict management is one of the most important interpersonal and team skills that project managers have to master. The success of project managers in managing their project teams often depends on their ability to resolve conflict. In the scenario described, the conflict is between the project manager and the team. The conflict is at the level that negatively impacts the team's morale and jeopardizes the project's goals. However, selecting the appropriate conflict resolution technique depends on the project manager and the circumstances surrounding the conflict. Under different circumstances, different project managers may use different conflict resolution methods. Factors that influence these methods include the importance and intensity of the conflict, time pressure for resolving the conflict, relative power of the people involved in the conflict, importance of maintaining a good relationship, motivation to resolve conflict on a long-term or short-term basis, etc.<br/>

There are five general techniques for resolving conflict: withdrawal/avoiding, smoothing/accommodating, compromising/reconciling, forcing/directing, collaborating/problem-solving. In the scenario, the project manager decides to avoid the conflict. There is not enough information in the scenario to determine whether the project manager's decision was right or wrong. However, this information is not required to answer the question correctly. All that is needed to select the correct answer is to understand the various degrees of desire to satisfy the concerns of the parties involved in the conflict and map the desire to the technique described in the scenario, keeping in mind that the scenario is presented from the project manager's perspective.<br/>Area A represents a low desire to satisfy team members' concerns but a high desire to satisfy the project manager's own concerns. From the project manager's perspective, this would be a force/direct technique, in which the project manager would push his/her viewpoint at the expense of the team, offering a win-lose solution. In the scenario described, the project manager decides to avoid the conflict, making this choice an incorrect answer.<br/>Area B represents a high desire to satisfy team members' concerns as well as a high desire to satisfy the project manager's own concerns. From the project manager's perspective, this would be a collaborate/problem-solve technique, in which multiple viewpoints and insights from different perspectives are incorporated. This approach typically results in a win-win situation. In the scenario described, the project manager decides to avoid the conflict, making this choice an incorrect answer.<br/>Area C represents a low desire to satisfy team members' concerns as well as a low desire to satisfy the project manager's own concerns. From the project manager's perspective, this would be an avoid/withdraw technique, in which parties retreat from an actual or potential conflict situation, postponing the issue to be better prepared or to be resolved by others. In the scenario described, the project manager decides to avoid the conflict, making this choice the best answer to the question asked.<br/></p></div></div></div></div><br/>

Understanding the project vision may help to answer questions such as, ""Why are we doing this project?"", ""Who benefits and how?"", etc. Communicating and re-communicating the project vision is essential to the success of the project as it establishes the central goal, the reason why the project is being undertaken in the first place, the outcomes for the performing organization and the customer. One of the duties of servant leaders is to communicate and re-communicate the project vision often enough to keep all project members working toward the same overall objective. Therefore, when an agile project leader identifies a situation, in which a stakeholder seems to be misaligned with the project vision, communicating the vision to the stakeholder and the rest of the meeting participants may help in re-routing the meeting back on track.<br/>While this course of action would likely resolve the issue described in the scenario, there is another approach, better aligned with agile best practices. Coaching the stakeholder on those practices would likely result in a more favorable outcome.<br/>Conflict, as long as it's healthy, is seen positively in an agile environment. In the scenario, the conflict sounds a bit intense. However, the essence of the question is about feature requests that are not aligned with the product vision. Conflict in this scenario is just ""collateral damage"". Allowing the conflict to continue would not address the root cause of the problem.<br/>Communicating and re-communicate the project vision to project stakeholders is an important duty of agile project leaders. Such communication should help minimize suggestions for product features that are not aligned with the project vision.

The business case is not likely to have details regarding maximizing the value of project deliverables after they have been delivered.<br/>The benefits management plan defines the benefits that are derived directly from the project’s deliverables, how the benefits continue into the future, how the value is maintained and improved, and who is responsible for doing that work.<br/>The question states that the project manager is about to start the processes associated with the Initiating Process Group. The stakeholder register is an output of the Identify Stakeholders process, which is part of the Initiating Process Group. Hence, the stakeholder register has not yet been created.<br/></p></div></div></div></div><br/>

Based on these estimates, the cost baseline is created. The scenario implies the project is in the Conduct Procurements process, which is part of the Executing Process Group. Therefore, the cost baseline must have been already approved before project execution begun. Updates to the cost baseline are among the outputs of the Conduct Procurements process. The scenario states that per the company policy if the response meets the specifications and the quality requirements, the requested service must be selected from one of these sellers. Therefore, the project must select a seller and adjust the cost baseline accordingly.<br/>

Breaking the policy or changing the specifications is not good practice, to say the least. Resending the same RFP to prospective sellers is only acceptable if errors or some other factor impacting all parties were discovered in the initial requests, which is not the case described in the scenario. An approved change request will be required to modify the cost baseline. However, this option is not provided. Therefore, of the choices provided, adjusting the cost baseline is the best answer to the question asked.<br/>Quality standards are established prior to the RFP being sent to potential sellers so that the sellers can provide estimates based on the specifications and the required quality level. Altering the quality expectations after the RFP has been sent and responded is unfair without proper procedures and communication.<br/>The cost baseline would be based on the expectations of the RFP. As the sellers responded, the baseline should be updated based on the new information. An approved change request will be required to modify the cost baseline.<br/> A procurement audit is a structured review of contracts and contracting processes for completeness, accuracy, and effectiveness. The audit will typically take place after the vendor delivered on the contract, while according to the scenario, the project has just received responses from the sellers implying no contract has been signed.<br/></p></div></div></div></div><br/>

Product owners prioritize work in the backlog based on value to the customer. Product owners work with the project teams daily by providing product feedback and setting direction on the next piece of functionality to be developed by the team in the upcoming sprint. The sprint review is a meeting where the project team demonstrates the product increment to the product owner and relevant stakeholders. The product owner makes the final call on whether the work demonstrated at the review is acceptable to the business and if it meets acceptance criteria. Therefore, if the product owner misses the sprint review, it will be unclear whether the product increment developed by the team during the sprint is accepted or not.<br/> The sprint review meeting is the opportunity for the team to demonstrate the product increment they developed during the sprint. One of the responsibilities of the product owner is to define what should be developed in each sprint. Therefore, without the product owner attending the spring review, the team will be unable to determine if the product increment they developed during the sprint is accepted or not.<br/>The determination as to whether the process the team uses to develop the product needs improvement or not is made at the sprint retrospective meeting, not the sprint review meeting described in the scenario. Besides, it is the team, not the product owner, who determines how to improve the development process.<br/>A typical sprint in an agile project lasts for 2 weeks. Without the product owner attending the spring review, the team would be unable to determine if the product increment they developed during the sprint is accepted or not, implying the work done over the 2 weeks could be a waste of time and project resources. Therefore, saying that there will be no significant consequences as a result of the product owner missing one sprint review meeting is an understatement.<br/></p></div></div></div></div><br/>

It seems from the scenario that the project is managed using traditional methods, as evident from the use of the work packages and the notion that project scope was rigorously defined. On traditional projects, stakeholder involvement is usually limited to milestones and gates. By suggesting a close collaboration between the project team, customer, and end-users, the project manager goes beyond the traditional methods and incorporates agile practices of stakeholder involvement, making the project hybrid. On agile/hybrid projects, it is common to see the project team, customer, and end-users closely working together, exchanging information in a dynamic co-creative process that leads to more stakeholder involvement and higher satisfaction. For example, in the project described in the scenario, the customer (the international fast-food chain) may engage with a pilot group of end-users and seek their feedback on the developed product increments (self-service ordering kiosks). The development team can then quickly adjust the product based on this feedback. These regular interactions with the stakeholder community throughout the project mitigate risk, build trust, and support adjustments earlier in the project life cycle, thus reducing costs and increasing the likelihood of project success.<br/>The resource breakdown structure is a project document that hierarchically represents resources by category and type. It is highly unlikely that the collaboration between the project team, customer, and end-users will have any effect on this document.<br/>It is reasonable to assume that the collaboration described in the scenario will clarify the work packages and lead to an increased (not decreased) velocity. There is not enough information in the scenario to determine if this collaboration will have any effect on WIP (if the team even uses a Kanban/task board to manage their workflow).<br/>It is unclear if a scrum master is assigned to the team. Even if yes, there is little to no correlation between the collaboration suggested by the project manager and the relationships between the project manager and the scrum master. The way the scenario is framed implies the project manager himself is acting in the capacity of a scrum master.<br/></p></div></div></div></div><br/>

Identifying the stakeholders includes those responsible for carrying out the quality management activities from each team, but also the others affected by the actions. The product owners, sponsors, project teams, and more are also affected by the work and potential changes in their work on the project. Therefore, identifying the stakeholders is the logical first step.<br/>Passing on the responsibility to one project team does not rid your project of managing quality. The management of quality should be a coordinated effort that evaluates each team’s needs and stakeholder expectations.<br/>Forcing one team to follow the methods of another may cause unnecessary disruption and, in most circumstances, is not the most logical first step, especially if one team conducts quality management activities differently than the other team. The aims of quality management may be the same, but their methods may differ.<br/>Breaking apart the team members from two projects to form a third team strictly focused on quality does not address the need to coordinate the quality methods used by the teams. There could be project team members concentrating on various aspects of the project, such as the management of quality, but the best practice is to keep them part of the larger project team.<br/></p></div></div></div></div><br/>

While managing the project team, the project manager makes reward decisions and implements them as part of the team development process. Unless the need arises to change the recognition plan, a project manager should adhere to the project plan. Since the work of creating a recognition and reward system should have already been done, the project manager's best approach would be to consult the resource management plan.<br/>Although this could be a good strategy, giving the team recognition throughout the project's life cycle rather than waiting until the project is completed would be a better course of action. Additionally, giving rewards without consulting the resource management plan first may go against the pre-determined process.<br/>Aside from being unrealistic in some cases, this approach is unlikely to be effective since the reward (the salary raise) is not tied to a specific behavior. A better strategy is to give rewards and recognition to employees who demonstrate desirable behavior. Regardless, this is not the first thing that should be done in the scenario described.<br/>Contests often focus on win-lose rewards, where one team member wins, and others do not. This can adversely affect team morale and group cohesion. A better course of action focuses on win-win rewards that promote team building and reward or recognize desirable behaviors. However, the resource management plan should be consulted first.<br/></p></div></div></div></div><br/>

In predictive projects, the work is planned upfront and then executed sequentially according to the project management plan. Once the work is completed and deliverables accepted, the project is closed. If for some reason, the project is terminated prematurely, no value is typically delivered to the customer. In the scenario described, the project is supposed to sequentially prepare infrastructure all across the planned region, then install the meters all across the planned region, and then upload the software all across the planned region. If the project is terminated at any point before the software is uploaded to the first meter, no value is delivered to the customer. The risk of premature closure can be mitigated by incorporating adaptive methods into a predictive project, making the project hybrid. These methods help deliver value frequently and incrementally. For example, the project can prepare infrastructure, install the meters, and upload the software in small chunks, e.g., one neighborhood at a time. With this approach, only if the project is terminated before the moment the software is uploaded to the first meter, no value is delivered. However, since the time required to complete the work in one neighborhood is much shorter than the time required to complete the work all across the planned region, there are more chances the project would deliver some value as opposed to delivering no value. Therefore, of the choices provided, suggesting switching the project from a multi-phase to one-phase approach and completing infrastructure preparation, meters' installation, and software upload in short iterations one neighborhood at a time is the best answer to the question asked.<br/>This course of action may ""buy"" some time for the team to complete more work in case the anti-wireless-technology groups try to block project work. However, without going into politics, if the groups are able to obtain a court order to stop the work, the project would be at risk of being terminated prematurely without any value delivered.<br/>This choice describes a plausible action that would likely allow delivering more value as opposed to working regular hours in case the project closes prematurely. However, working extra time over long periods is not sustainable and would negatively impact the motivation and well-being of the project team as well as the quality of deliverables.<br/>This incremental adaptive approach will shorten the time period during which at least one meter is up and running and deliver value as opposed to the original approach in which the first meter will be operational only after all infrastructure is prepared, all meters are installed, and the software is uploaded to the first meter.<br/></p></div></div></div></div><br/>

Audits are among the tools and techniques of this process and are typically used to evaluate a documented procedure to ensure the procedure is being carried out according to plan and analyzed for improvements. In this situation, an audit can be used to review the schedule for the delivery of material per the contract. The audit results inform the project manager whether changes need to be made to the schedule. If the seller is delinquent in delivering the material, the audit results will also allow the project manager to determine what, if any, corrective action should be taken. The key phrase that may help in selecting the correct answer is the ""procurement process"". Audits are a structured review of the procurement process. Since the project manager wants to determine if any adjustments to the procurement process are required, an audit would be the best tool to use in this situation.<br/>As it pertains to procurements, an inspection is a structured review of the work being performed by the contractor. This may involve a simple review of the deliverables or an actual physical review of the work itself. Although an inspection of work output is sometimes called an 'audit,' there is no inspection of a process. In this case, the procurement process is audited, not inspected. The main difference between an inspection and audit is that the former is concerned with a product while the latter is concerned with a process. Since the question is asking about the procurement process, an inspection would not be the best answer.<br/>An audit, as a tool of the Control Procurements process, is how contract performance is monitored via a structured review of the procurement process. The project manager would conduct an audit to compare the supplier's obligations to deliver the material as outlined in the contract versus their actual performance. Results of the audit would determine if corrective action needs to be taken.<br/> An independent estimate is an estimate provided by a third party to support the prediction of cost, schedule, or other items. An independent estimate does not evaluate a seller's performance.<br/></p></div></div></div></div><br/>

When some aspects of the procurement are well-defined up-front but others are unknown or variable, the parties to the contract may use a multi-tiered contract structure. This contracting technique allows for capturing various aspects of the procurement in different documents. For example, mostly fixed items, such as warranties and arbitration, can be locked in a master services agreement (MSA), while more dynamic items, such as scope, schedule, and budget, can be formalized in a lightweight statement of work. In the scenario, the scope is subject to change and will be elaborated as the project progresses. Therefore, while contracting with the seller, the lightweight statement of work would be the project manager's best choice to address the scope part of the procurement. This multi-tiered contract structure reflects a hybrid project management approach in which part of the procurement is managed using predictive methods, while the other part is addressed with agile contracting techniques.<br/>A master services agreement (MSA) is a contract between the buyer and seller that can be used with a hybrid project management approach when the overall engagement for the contracted work is documented in the main part of the MSA, while the adaptive portion of the work is placed in an appendix or supplement. While the MSA is a plausible answer, it's not the best. Another answer choice precisely addresses the question asked.<br/>The lightweight statement of work can be used to contract with the seller for those work items that cannot be defined up-front and will likely change as the project progresses. In the scenario, the scope meets this criterion and, therefore, is a good candidate to be addressed by such a statement of work, making this choice the best answer to the question asked.<br/>Source selection analysis is one of the tools and techniques that can be used as part of the Plan Procurement Management process implied by the scenario. This analysis is used, as its name implies, to select a seller for the procurement, rather than address the variable parts of the procured work, as asked by the question<br/></p></div></div></div></div><br/>

Organizational process assets may be updated with project records such as correspondence, memos, meeting minutes, project reports, presentations and other documents used on the project. The meeting minutes are considered an organizational process asset and could be archived for future reference. Typically, after the meeting, the meeting minutes are distributed to the meeting participants and other project stakeholders as specified in the communications management plan. Then the meeting minutes can be archived as part of the OPAs update. However, an option that describes both of these steps is not provided as one of the answer choices. Therefore, we have to select the answer that, among the choices given, best addresses the question asked. Among the choices provided, documenting the meeting minutes in the OPAs is the best answer to the question asked.<br/>The ‘meeting minutes register’ is a term made-up for this question.<br/>The communications management plan establishes how, when, and by whom information about the project will be administered and disseminated. The communications management plan does not serve as an archive for meeting notes.<br/>Lessons learned from the meeting may be captured in the lessons learned register for use later in the project. However, the question is not asking about where the knowledge gained from the meeting should be documented to improve the performance of the project. Rather, the question is simply asking about what should be done with the meeting minutes. Meeting minutes are considered project records and typically contain information that does not pertain to lessons learned. Recording the meeting minutes in the lessons learned register is unlikely to serve the purpose for which the lessons learned register was created.<br/></p></div></div></div></div><br/>

For the Develop Project Charter process, meetings are held with key stakeholders to identify project objectives, success criteria, key deliverables, high-level requirements, summary milestones, and other summary information. Therefore, the best way to obtain information on key deliverables is to facilitate a meeting with key stakeholders.<br/>

One may argue that as long as the project charter is not yet approved, the project manager does not have the authority to engage stakeholders in any meetings or even know who the key project stakeholders are. While there is merit to this argument, a project manager is identified and assigned as early in the project as is feasible, preferably while the project charter is being developed. It is reasonable to assume that the sponsor would inform the project manager of the key stakeholders. Waiting for the project charter to be approved and only then collect inputs from stakeholders would introduce an unnecessary delay to the project.<br/> Meetings are one of the tools and techniques associated with the Develop Project Charter process. For this process, meetings are held with key stakeholders to identify key deliverables and other summary information.<br/>While the project sponsor is undoubtedly a source for information regarding the key deliverables of the project, input should be sought from other key stakeholders and not limited to the project sponsor.<br/>The project scope statement contains a description of the project scope, major deliverables, and exclusions. However, the question suggests that the project is still in the initiation stage. The project scope statement is created during the Define Scope process, which occurs later in project planning.<br/></p></div></div></div></div><br/>

</div></div> </div></div></div><div class='answer'><a class='ans' onclick='showHide(581)'>Ans</a><p style='display:none;' id='ans_581'>4--When using agile methodologies, the project manager adopts the role of a servant leader. Although the project team is responsible for assessing their capacity for work and determining the number of story points that will be planned for the upcoming sprint, the project manager supports the team by providing relevant information that might help the team make an informed decision. The project team members need to understand their past performance and use that information as a basis for planning the upcoming sprint. The project team may not realize that their commitment to complete 60 story points represents a 50% increase in productivity. As a servant leader, it would be important for the project manager to ensure that the project team has this information so they can make an informed decision. If the project team still wants to commit to 60 story points for the upcoming sprint, then the project manager should support their decision even if he or she feels it is unrealistic. If the sprint fails, then there will be a valuable lesson learned for the project team.<br/>

Note, the question describes a hybrid project where the product is developed using agile methods while the schedule is managed using the schedule baseline, which is a component of the project management plan typically used in traditional projects.<br/> Agile teams are self-managing and are in the best position to determine their capacity for work. However, if the project manager has relevant information that might help the team to plan the sprint and avoid potential mistakes, then sharing that information with the team would be appropriate and necessary.<br/>It would not be appropriate to submit a change request to revise the schedule baseline based on the information provided by the question. We do not know whether the project is currently running behind or ahead of schedule. It also remains to be seen if the project team can really deliver 60 story points in the upcoming sprint.<br/>While the team is empowered to determine its capacity for work, the project manager has a good reason to question the team's ability to deliver 60 story points based on their current velocity. In spite of this, it would not be appropriate for the project manager to ignore the team's commitment and substitute it with his or her own plan.<br/></p></div></div></div></div><br/>

In this scenario, a single large training class was conducted for all of the employees (stakeholders). While this probably was the most cost-efficient way of delivering the training, it clearly was not the most effective. One of the advantages of incremental delivery is the ability to learn from each progressive iteration and apply those learnings to improve the performance of future iterations. In this case, starting with a small group of training, participants should have uncovered the problems with the training so they could be addressed with future groups. By incorporating elements of agile like incremental delivery to an otherwise predictive project, the project becomes a hybrid. Although this strategy may not have prevented a small spike in timesheet issues for the payroll department, the volume of issues would have been greatly reduced, which may have prevented the payroll department from being overwhelmed, delaying the paychecks.<br/>A project retrospective should be conducted at the end of the project to capture the knowledge gained during the project. Capturing the lessons learned from this project may improve performance for future projects. However, a project retrospective is conducted at the end of the project and would not have prevented any of the problems described in the question.<br/>Risk responses are implemented after a risk has been realized.

This approach allows the stakeholders to be constantly updated with the progress of the project and provide feedback to the project team as to how well the product (or service) meets stakeholder expectations. To apprise stakeholders of value gain progress, agile teams that develop project deliverables using iterations hold product demonstrations at the end of each iteration. At these agile events, the team members demonstrate the working product increment to the stakeholders, who, in turn, have the opportunity firsthand to see and touch (depending on the nature of the deliverables) the actual product. Therefore, of the choices provided, demonstrating the product at the end of each iteration is the best answer to the question asked.<br/>Value stream mapping is a lean enterprise technique used to document, analyze, and improve the flow of information or materials required to produce a product service for a customer. This technique is typically used by agile teams to identify waste in their process, reduce process cycle times, and implement process improvement. Apprising stakeholders of value gain progress is not achieved by this technique.<br/>This answer choice describes an iteration review meeting, which is an agile event specifically designed to apprise stakeholders of value gain progress. The team demonstrates the product increment developed in the iteration and seeks for stakeholder feedback. A working product increment provides value for the customer.<br/>An earned value analysis (EVA) is an example of the data analysis tools and techniques that is used to compare the performance measurement baseline to the actual schedule and cost performance. While this technique can also be used in agile projects, performing the EVA on a daily basis is not the most effective way to apprise stakeholders of value gain progress. Demonstrating a working product increment to stakeholders more accurately addresses the question asked as well as is better aligned with agile best practices.<br/></p></div></div></div></div><br/>

Applying this role to the scenario provided, synchronizing everyone's understanding of agile, especially when the team members are coming from different organizations, have various backgrounds and agile experience, and used different agile methods, is essential prior to tailoring agile methods. One option for a new agile team is to start with adopting the agile approach that has been proven effective in the organization. Then, the team can tailor the approach based on the lessons learned. However, a better course of action would be to first ensure that the meeting participants have a shared understanding of agile. Otherwise, premature and haphazard tailoring can minimize the effects of the approach and, eventually, limit its benefits.<br/>While mixing Scrum, Kanban, and XP is a common tailoring approach used by agile teams, the scenario suggests that the team members come from different organizations, have various backgrounds and agile experience. Premature and haphazard tailoring can minimize the effects of the approach and limit benefits.<br/>Agile teams often tailor processes or analyze the existing processes and make adjustments and improvements as necessary as they progress through an iteration, release, or project. While process tailoring may indeed save time as compared to applying one known agile approach, avoiding 'any' process tailoring is an extreme course action and would miss its potential benefits in the long term.<br/>With a mix of different agile experiences and methods used among the team members, synchronizing everyone's understanding of agile should be the first step for the agile coach in this situation. After the team has a shared understanding, selecting the best agile method would be easier.<br/></p></div></div></div></div><br/>

Since the software development phase of the project will use an agile framework, the product owner will serve a vital role. Having a stakeholder with a great deal of power over a project with little interest is a significant issue. The product owner, for whatever reason, might even be resistant to the project. It will be most important for the project manager to develop engagement strategies designed to increase the support of the product owner; otherwise, the lack of engagement from the product owner may cause the project to fail.<br/>

Note, the scenario describes a hybrid project in which elements of a traditional project management approach (such as the stakeholder engagement plan) are combined with those of agile methodologies. While this information is not essential to answering this question, knowing that the real PMP exam may depict such scenarios may help in your preparations and reduce stress while taking the exam.<br/>The product owner has been identified as having high power but very low interest in the project. It is possible that the product owner might even be resistant to the project. Developing plans to ensure that the product owner is supportive of the project will be critical for the project's success.<br/>While it's important that the product eventually meets the needs of the end-users, granting them with as much power as possible may be unrealistic and may actually derail the project. It's the responsibility of the product owner, who represents the customer, who, in turn, represents the end-users to ensure the product meets customer expectations.<br/>Plans should be put in place to ensure that the project sponsor remains highly supportive. However, according to the current power/interest grid, the project sponsor is already highly supportive of the project. Therefore, it seems that there is little room to increase the sponsor's level of support even higher.<br/></p></div></div></div></div><br/>

Quality is defined as the degree to which the product fulfills the requirements. Grade refers to the classification of products that have a common function but offer different technical specifications. In the scenario described, concrete is used as the foundation of the home and as a patio. However, the stronger concrete supports a higher weight and is, therefore, a higher-grade concrete. The quality of either concrete will be determined by whether it meets the established quality requirements that are defined in the quality management plan, not by its grade. The scenario does not give us any information on the quality of the patio, only that the higher-grade concrete was used. Since higher grade does not mean higher quality, the only correct answer of all the options given is that the patio will be of a higher grade than planned.<br/>In the scenario described, the stronger concrete is a higher grade, but not necessarily higher quality. Quality and grade are not the same concepts. Different grades are used to describe deliverables that have the same function but different technical characteristics. Quality is defined as the degree to which the established requirements are met. The stronger concrete is a higher grade because it supports a higher weight. However, just because the concrete is a higher grade, does not necessarily mean the patio has met the established quality requirements. The higher-grade concrete could be of low quality if the mixing or pouring resulted in a patio that fails to meet the quality metrics.<br/>The standard concrete is of lower 'grade', not lower quality. Grade describes a product's technical specifications, for example, the standard concrete supports less weight than the stronger, 'high-grade' concrete. Quality is defined by how well the product meets the established requirements. A low-grade product can be of high quality if it meets the established quality metrics for the product, for example, zero defects. Therefore, the lower grade concrete is not necessarily of lower quality, making this answer incorrect.<br/>Grade describes a product's technical specifications, for example, a product with a higher grade may have more functions.

Different options should be thoroughly discussed to make the best-informed decision. In the situation described in the question, the team members are unable to reach a consensus after a long discussion, and therefore, due to time limitations, the quickest way to make a decision should be selected. Under the circumstances described in the scenario and with the given set of the answer choices, simple voting is the quickest way to make a decision in a participatory fashion.<br/>

Three things are important to keep in mind while answering this question. First, simple voting is the least favorable decision-making technique because it limits the opportunities to refine the resulting decision. Second, if the number of participants is even, the result might be a tie. Therefore, prior to casting a vote, a tie-breaking rule should be defined (for example, a scrum master, a team lead, a project manager, or any other team member, e.g., the most senior developer, will have a tie-breaking vote). And lastly, even though this technique is not the best among the other participatory decision models, such as ‘thumbs up/down/sideways’, ‘fist-of-five’, etc., it does not mean this answer choice should be eliminated. While not ideal, simple voting is still the best option among the choices provided.<br/>Involving the project sponsor in decision making related to technical aspects of the project is an over-reaction. Not only unilateral decisions are not the best approach in agile projects, but it is likely that the project sponsor may not have as much technical knowledge as the development team members themselves. The sponsor may not even be available, while, according to the scenario, the decision should be made by the end of the meeting.<br/>Voting is an example of the decision-making technique that is typically used as part of a meeting, such as the one described in the scenario. While not ideal, simple voting is a quick way to make a decision when time is of the essence.<br/>User stories are aimed to describe a feature or functionality to be developed by a project rather than address questions on the development approach to be used on the project.<br/></p></div></div></div></div><br/>

The product owner may decide to cancel the current sprint and start a new sprint that includes this new high priority requirement. In this case, the team likely needs time to assess the impact of the new mandatory compliance-related requirement.<br/>

According to the reference provided, ""The Product Owner may cancel a Sprint at any time, usually because the Sprint Goal isn't going to be met or because the Sprint Goal is no longer what is needed. In either case, the Sprint's work is evaluated to see what can be kept, and whether or not a re-planning is called for."" There is a reciprocal commitment between the parties where the team has committed to delivering 100% of the specified functionality according to the definition of done at the end of the sprint, and the product owner, organization, and customer agreed not to add new user stories or change priorities during the sprint. Although reciprocal commitment is an important agile principle, it is by no means absolute. The situation described in the scenario can happen in real life, where change has significant business or technological implications (such as a compliance issue), and therefore drastic measures such as canceling the sprint may be required.<br/>Adding the new requirement to the product backlog is the right action. However, due to the deemed urgency, importance, and potential implications of the requirement on the project, informing the product owner immediately rather than waiting for them to review the requirement later after the sprint is over would be a better choice.<br/>The scrum master should discuss the new requirement with the product owner who, together with the team, may decide to cancel the sprint. In that case, the product owner and the team will have to re-plan the work for this and future sprints.<br/>In traditional or hybrid projects with a change control system in place, an approved change request is needed for a new requirement to be added to the project scope. The scenario does not have enough information as to whether the project has a change control system.

A hybrid project incorporates elements of predictive and agile methodologies. Therefore, it is reasonable to assume that the project has at least a basic project management plan. The team charter is a document that records the team values, agreements, and operating guidelines, as well as establishes expectations regarding acceptable behavior by project team members. The scenario implies that the team charter either was not created or did not adequately cover standard working hours and respecting team members' personal time. A team charter is a useful document that can be incorporated into any project regardless of the project management framework. When a project management plan exists, the team charter is created as an output of the Plan Resource Management process as an element of the resource management plan. Had the project manager facilitated a meeting to define the team working agreements and recorded the agreements in the team charter, the situation described by the question might have been avoided or, at least, its impact reduced.<br/>The question implies that the team's working agreements were not developed or are insufficient. Creating the team working agreements earlier in project planning could have helped avoid the situation described in the scenario or, at least, could have reduced its severity.<br/>The daily standup is a timeboxed agile ceremony during which the project team reviews progress from the previous day, declare intentions for the current day, and identifies any impediments to their work. Iteration planning is mainly aimed to set up goals for the upcoming iteration. Although the lack of team working agreements might be identified as an impediment during the daily standup, neither daily standup nor iteration planning meetings are appropriate forums to create a team charter.<br/>It would be nice to have the option of selecting only experienced team members for your project.

According to the scenario described, the new regulations are so complicated that you have trouble understanding them and their implications for the project.

Explicit knowledge can be readily codified, and the question implies that only explicit knowledge is being transferred to the other project teams. Tacit knowledge (beliefs, insights, experience, and know-how) is very difficult to codify. Codified explicit knowledge lacks context and is open to misinterpretation. Tacit knowledge can more easily be transferred through communication and personal interaction. The scenario describes a hybrid project, in which the project manager has effectively transferred the codified explicit knowledge. However, the project manager did not capture the tacit knowledge residing in the minds of the project team members (for reasons described above). Having the other project managers attend the project retrospective and interact with the project with the team members would better facilitate the transfer of tacit knowledge.<br/>

Note, having the other project managers attend the project retrospective is not always feasible for various reasons. However, as far as the exam is concerned, one should select the answer that best addresses the question asked, regardless of how unrealistic the answer may look and feel. Not all questions and/or answer choices on the real exam would make perfect sense. We hope that encountering such questions in the simulated exam would better prepare you for the real one.<br/>The scenario does imply that tacit knowledge is being lost by simply recording information in the lessons learned register. However, codifying tacit knowledge is very difficult due to its nature. This type of knowledge is more effectively transferred by conversations and personal interactions.<br/>The lessons learned repository is an organizational process asset. The lessons learned register is finalized and transferred to the lessons learned repository as part of project closure. Therefore, this answer choice represents an activity that has already been completed.<br/>The question suggests that tacit knowledge is being lost since only explicit knowledge has been captured in the lessons learned register. Having other project managers attend the project retrospective and interact with the team members who have carried out the work on this project would help facilitate the transfer of tacit knowledge.<br/></p></div></div></div></div><br/>

The project manager should have the authority to secure the required resources to execute the project. Only if the project manager does not succeed, and there is no other way to resolve the issue, should the project manager escalate the issue to the project sponsor.

Therefore, unless the project manager is the only individual authorized to decide on changes (which cannot be determined from the information provided in the question), the project manager cannot defer the change request at-will after it has already been approved. The project manager can defer the ‘implementation’ of the change request if an individual with the necessary expertise to implement it is unavailable but deferring the change request and deferring the implementation of the change request are two different things.<br/></p></div></div></div></div><br/>

Thus, the existing project must first be terminated, and then the project scope can be incorporated into the larger project.

Much of how, when, and how much communication in hybrid projects is based on the needs and expectations of the project stakeholders involved. There may be small or large scale changes when alternating between the various approaches and timelines used in a hybrid project. As such, it is critical that a project manager stay in tune with the explicit and implicit communication needs and propose changes, tweaks, or adaptations as appropriate.<br/>

Note, based on how the scenario is framed, it is reasonable to assume that the project is overall managed traditionally, implying there a project management plan in place. A communications management plan, which is a component of the project management plan, will have to be updated to reflect the adjusted communications during sprints. An approved change request is required to update any component of the project management plan.<br/>The normal communication cadence is disrupted when the project shifts back and forth between the work carried out using plan-driven project management methodologies and the agile approach. As such, the continuation of normal communication cadence would not work. An alternative or revised communication schedule is needed.<br/>While the use of information radiators to display the project status is a common agile practice, this approach cannot be taken unilaterally without consulting with project stakeholders. For example, there is not enough information in the scenario to determine if all relevant stakeholders will be able to access the team working space.<br/>The normal communication was disrupted with the incorporation of agile methodologies. The hybrid project described in the scenario requires evaluation and analysis of the communications, along with proposals as to recommended changes to the project communications to best suit the needs of all stakeholders.<br/></p></div></div></div></div><br/>

A Monte Carlo simulation is an analysis technique where a computer model is iterated many times with the input values chosen at random for each iteration driven by the input data, including probability distributions and probabilistic branches. Variability risks can be analyzed using the Monte Carlo simulation with the range of variation reflected in probability distributions, followed by actions to reduce the spread of possible outcomes. The analysis simulates the combined effects of individual project risks and other sources of uncertainty to evaluate their potential impact on achieving project objectives. Thus, performing a Monte Carlo simulation could have led to better risk planning and understanding the combined effects of the individual risks and is, therefore, of the choices provided, the best answer to the question asked.<br/>Sensitivity analysis helps to determine which individual project risks or other sources of uncertainty have the most potential impact on project outcomes.

Risk reviews are scheduled regularly and aimed to examine and document the effectiveness of risk responses in dealing with overall project risk and with identified individual project risks. To monitor and control risks on agile projects, practitioners typically use a different set of tools and techniques. On agile projects, risk monitoring activities are embedded as an integral part of the work process. As stated by the authors in the reference, ""Risks are monitored on a daily basis by the use of highly visible information radiators such as task boards and burndown charts, which show the current status. Daily stand-up meetings contribute to the constant monitoring process by exposing potential risk triggers and new risks."" Individuals who transition from traditional to agile projects sometimes find it hard to adapt to the agile methodology. Therefore, the best solution for the project manager on the hybrid project described in the scenario would be a combination of traditional and agile tools, such as risk burndown charts, daily stand-up meetings, and risk reviews.<br/>Sensitivity analysis is one of the data analysis techniques that can be used as part of the Perform Quantitative Risk Analysis process. Risk probability and impact assessment is one of the data analysis techniques that can be used during the Perform Qualitative Risk Analysis process. The question is asking about the Monitor Risks process.<br/>A risk-based spike is a time-boxed effort to investigate an issue or risk. Carrying out the risk-based spike may help avoid risk. However, iteration 'Zero' and/or an architectural spike do not address the issue. For example, iteration ‘Zero’ is used by agile teams to set up a development environment, while an architectural spike is a time-boxed effort to verify the feasibility of a technical approach.<br/>A risk burndown chart is an information radiator that shows risk exposure remained over time (iterations). Daily stand-up meetings contribute to the monitoring process by exposing potential risk triggers and new risks. Risk reviews examine the effectiveness of risk responses.

</div></div> </div></div></div><div class='answer'><a class='ans' onclick='showHide(613)'>Ans</a><p style='display:none;' id='ans_613'>4--It is quite common for a team to have a bit of unfinished work at the end of an iteration. Ideally, a team would finish every item on its iteration backlog in every iteration, but, for a variety of reasons, that is not always the case. The scenario describes a hybrid project with the scope being developed using agile practices but managed with traditional WBS. In this environment, the project manager does not have the authority unilaterally decide on scope and schedule. The product owner must be involved. When the project experiences work delays/overruns due to insufficiently refined product backlog items or WBS packages, like the one described in the scenario, the project manager can choose, together with the team and the product owner, to split package (user story) B into smaller packages (stories) focused on specific functionality described in the package. If split, part of the work of package B could be completed and delivered and the rest of the work added to the WBS as a separate package. Also, package A would also be placed back in the WBS for future prioritization. Or it could be that package A is nearly as important to the business and the instructions to the complete it first could be the appropriate decision.<br/>

Regardless of the situation, the development team should report their concerns to the project manager and product owner and follow their decision. It is the product owner’s job to determine the proper course of action and instruct the team. In this scenario, the team is approaching the end of the final iteration in the next release. The length of the iteration is fixed and under most circumstances, should not be changed. The team should rely on the product owner to represent the project stakeholders and make a decision which is appropriate for the circumstances described.<br/>The length of an iteration is fixed and should not be changed except for in special circumstances. Even then, approval from the product should be obtained. Nothing in the scenario indicates that the situation is unusual. Therefore, extending the iteration length at will is unlikely to be the best course of action for the project manager.<br/>While it makes sense that higher priority work packages should be completed first, the decision should not be made unilaterally by the project manager. On projects where the scope is developed using agile practices, as with the situation described in the scenario, it's the product owner who typically makes scope-related decisions.<br/>Although this may seem logical, the project manager cannot decide unilaterally, especially knowing that story B is of higher value to the business. On projects where the scope is developed using agile practices, as with the situation described in the scenario, it's the product owner who typically makes scope-related decisions.<br/></p></div></div></div></div><br/>

Some of the characteristics presented in the correct answer choice are derived from eXtreme Programming (XP) core practices. They include collective code ownership, consistent and strict coding standards, pair programming, test-driven development (TDD), continuous integration, refactoring, and simple designs. In addition to these practices, is the concept of ""whole team"", which is the idea that all agile team members are collocated and, ideally, act as generalizing specialists. A generalizing specialist is a team member who can serve in many agile roles or capacities, for example, develop code, integrate software modules, test product increments, and even serve as an agile coach, if necessary. Therefore, an individual with a diverse skill set to be able to play many agile roles and be a versatile team player would be the best candidate to backfill the position of the agile team member who left the project.<br/>This choice describes great qualities for a developer to possess. Being an expert at coding and working well with others would be good qualities for any team. However, an agile team values certain qualities and characteristics that are beyond the specific expertise.<br/>Agile team practices emphasize the idea of generalizing specialists. Often those most valuable on the team are members who can develop, test, and play other roles and can switch responsibilities and tasks as the need arises. A team of generalizing specialists has less loss of information and rarely has anyone waiting or idle.<br/>Having development experience with a wide range of products is beneficial for any agile team. While this answer choice represents a good answer, it is not the best. Another answer choice better addresses the question asked.<br/></p></div></div></div></div><br/>

To resolve a conflict, the scrum master should focus on the issue at hand. The scrum master should communicate well by actively listening where it helps to restate and rephrase problems when communicating with the team. The scrum master has to be able to deal with situations. At times, when conflict can reach an impasse or emotions run high, a scrum master may recommend a break to allow members some time to cool down or to step away from the issue. This break (not a disengagement from work) may prevent further intensifying of the conflict and may allow time for other solutions to resolve conflict to present themselves.<br/>The existence of a conflict is not necessarily attributed to people. Focusing on people rather than on issues may cause the people to become defensive and eventually close. Focusing on issues rather than individuals may help open a dialogue leading to a potential conflict resolution.<br/>An iteration retrospective meeting is an agile event to reflect on and adapt the process used by the team to develop the product. While theoretically having a human resources representative at the retrospective meeting may be a good idea, this course of action should not come first. The scrum master, as a servant leader, should first try to attempt to resolve the conflict on his/her own.<br/>Being assertive rather than submissive means acting decisively with confidence, but not aggression. Good agile leaders know how to be proactive rather than passive. Listening and analytical skills are crucial in understanding the conflict and finding the best way to resolve it.<br/></p></div></div></div></div><br/>

The safety regulations are an example of a mandatory external requirement that represents a constraint to the project and are included among the enterprise environmental factors (EEFs) under which the project operates. Even though the addition of the new safety features is mandatory, an approved change request is still required since the project is operating under the auspices of an approved project management plan and the scope baseline. At a minimum, the scope baseline will need to be revised to incorporate the additional scope. It is also possible that the cost and schedule baseline will be affected as well. Thus, the project manager will need first to submit a change request to update the project management plan. Once the change request has been approved, the features can be incorporated into the project's scope.<br/>Since the project is operating under the auspices of a project management plan, including the scope baseline, an approved change request would be required to modify any aspect of the project management plan, such as the scope baseline.

Regardless of whether the root cause analysis should or should not be conducted, addressing the new safety features is necessary as required by the regulator.<br/>The MoSCoW model of prioritization categories features as ""must have"", ""should have"", ""could have"", and ""won't have"".

However, traditional managers are constantly trying to correct actual results to a baseline, which is referred to as 'corrective action' and is used to guide the project team back to the original plan. Agile project leaders are interested in reacting and adapting to project events rather than following a predictive plan, which is referred to as 'adaptive action', and is used to determine what actions to take to adapt to the plan rather than to get back in line with the original plan. In agile project management, 'adaptive action' is used to describe which course of action to take to adjust the project plans to reflect the new project circumstances.<br/>Corrective action is an intentional activity that realigns the performance of the project work with the project management plan.

In this scenario, a change request to expand the scope of the project was submitted to the change control board for review and analysis of its impact on the project. Once approved, the status of the change request is updated in the change log. The next logical step would be implementing the change. However, the scenario describes a new project manager who is likely not familiar with the change control processes defined for this particular project. One should look for the answer choice that best addresses the question asked under the circumstances provided in the scenario. If consulting the change management plan was not among the answer choices, then directing the project team to implement the change would have been the best answer. However, since each organization and each project within the organization may have its own change control process (which is specified in the change management plan), consulting this plan should be the first thing the newly assigned project manager should do. For example, the change management plan may require the project manager to inform particular stakeholders about the approved change so that they may take actions assigned to them as part of the procedure prior to the implementation of the change. Therefore, in this case, consulting the change management plan is the best answer among the choices given in the situation described by the scenario.<br/>Eventually, the approved change should be implemented. However, among the choices provided, directing the project team to implement the change is not the first thing for the project manager to do. There is another answer choice that more accurately addresses the question asked.<br/>When a change request is approved, project resources are allocated to support the implementation of the change. Waiting for further changes (that may or may not be requested) would be wasting the allocated resources that otherwise could have been used for other project activities or re-allocated to other projects.<br/>Typically, once the change is approved, it should be implemented. However, each organization and each project within the organization has an established procedure to manage changes as outlined in the change management plan.

A CPI of 0.8 and an SPI of 1.2 indicates that the project is over budget and ahead of schedule. Therefore, costs must be reduced to meet the project budget. Reducing or eliminating the independent contractors, to the extent that the project schedule allows without impacting the schedule baseline, will reduce costs to bring project performance back into alignment with the project management plan, and that is the best course of action given the circumstances provided by the question.<br/>A cost performance index (CPI) of 0.8 indicates that the project is already over budget and approving overtime will increase costs which will increase the performance gap rather than correct it.<br/>A cost performance index (CPI) of 0.8 and a schedule performance index (SPI) of 1.2 indicates that the project is over budget and ahead of schedule. Reducing or eliminating the independent contractors, assuming it is permitted by the contract, will reduce costs to bring project performance back into alignment with the project management plan.<br/>Fast tracking is a schedule compression technique, and the cost performance index (CPI) of 0.8 is the variance that needs to be addressed.

It is important to note a PMP aspirant may encounter unfamiliar terms and concepts on the real exam, which may not even be needed to answer the question correctly. This superfluous information might confuse or distract the aspirant, so it is important to identify what information is needed and what information is not needed when answering exam questions. No specific knowledge of SAFe® and the associated ceremonies is required to answer this question correctly. All that is really needed to answer the question is an understanding that there are several geographically dispersed project teams that are required to conduct a planning meeting. The type/name of the planning meeting is irrelevant. Ideally, the project teams would come together for a face-to-face meeting and then return to their home bases, but that option was not listed among the alternatives. Therefore, the 'best' answer is to provide the team with virtual tools (e.g., audio and video tools) to replicate a face-to-face meeting in a virtual environment.<br/>Bringing the project teams together to conduct the Program Increment (PI) Planning in person would be ideal. However, the question indicates that, although the individual project teams are co-located, each team is geographically dispersed. There is no reason (nor is it clear if there are even resources) to physically colocate all of the project teams for the entire project just to accommodate a meeting that will only occur every eight weeks.<br/>When using a waterfall project management approach, the work breakdown structure (WBS) should be decomposed down to the work package level. The work packages can then be further decomposed into an activity list, and the activities can be assigned to individual team members. However, the question stipulates that the enterprise is transitioning to SAFe®, which is among the agile methodologies. With agile methodologies, the project scope is progressively elaborated rather than fully planned in advance of project execution.<br/>This answer choice describes a daily standup meeting. The daily standup meeting is a timeboxed and narrowly focused agile ceremony during which the project team coordinates their activities. It would not be appropriate to conduct project planning during a daily standup meeting, nor will it be realistic to complete program planning in 15 minutes.<br/></p></div></div></div></div><br/>

Velocity is typically used on agile projects and simply represents the average number of story points that are completed per sprint. Velocity can differ between project teams for a variety of reasons, independently of how productive the team is. For example, team size, the skill set of the team members, the complexity and the nature of the project all influence the team's capacity for work. More importantly, each project team typically determines its own definition of a story point. The purpose of assigning story points is to provide a relative size for each work item in the project backlog. This information can then be used to calculate velocity and produce burn charts to provide information about the project's progress. Since each team may define a story point differently, a meaningful comparison cannot be made between project teams. In this situation, you, as the project leader, should take the opportunity and mentor the members of the steering committee by explaining agile best practices and how to properly interpret the velocity metric.<br/>Expecting the project team to double productivity is probably unrealistic. Additionally, when incorporating agile best practices, the capacity for work during each sprint is determined by the team, not the team/project leader/manager.<br/>Increasing the size of the project team might increase velocity. However, since the size of a story point is typically defined by individual project teams, one should not attempt to compare the velocity of one team to another. Therefore, concluding that there is a problem with the team's productivity is not warranted.<br/>There is not enough information in the scenario to correlate between the team's velocity and the project schedule. Additionally, unless stated otherwise, it is the schedule baseline, not the project schedule, that requires an approved change request to be modified.<br/></p></div></div></div></div><br/>

With this approach, the product will be ready for the customer only at the end of the project. The way agile methods address product development differ from the traditional approach. In agile, the product is developed incrementally via short iterations with continuous feedback from the customer and stakeholders. Each iteration results in a working product increment that can be used by the customer, thus providing business value to both the customer and the performing organization. If the project closes prematurely, there is a chance that some useful business value will already have been generated. This allows premature closure to be less of a failure due to sunk costs and more of an early benefits realization, quick win, or proof of concept for the business. By incorporating agile methods into a traditionally managed project, the project would become hybrid.<br/>While only some of the techniques described in this answer choice belong to schedule compression and would have helped accelerate the completion of the project as a whole, the sequential planning, development, and testing approach selected in the scenario would have still been a bottleneck in delivering early value to the customer.<br/>Applying the strategy described in this answer choice would have likely addressed some of the drawbacks of the current project management approach. However, this action does not address the main issue described in the scenario, which is waiting for all work packages to be completed before testing can begin, thus delivering no early value.<br/>When a project is terminated prematurely, the costs spent up to the point of termination are considered sunk. Regardless of how big contingency and management reserves were during project planning, covering sunk costs would not have helped the project in delivering value to the customer prior to project termination.<br/></p></div></div></div></div><br/>

Configuration audits ensure that the composition of a project's configuration items is correct, and corresponding changes are registered, assessed, approved, tracked, and correctly implemented.

Therefore, of the available choices, asking the CCB to perform a configuration audit is the only option that might prevent the problem from recurring.<br/>

First, the scenario states the performing organization does not have the required expertise; second, the determination as to what approach is cheaper should be made only after the make-or-buy analysis is performed; lastly, choices with absolute statements, such as 'always', 'never', etc. typically represent incorrect answers.<br/></p></div></div></div></div><br/>

The scenario implies that the resource management plan called for the use of analogous estimating to estimate the team resources required for the project. The previous similar project had a fully dedicated team of four developers. However, for the current project, the team members are not fully dedicated and would need to devote 25% of their time to another project. Even though the total labor hours of the five team members working 75% of their time equal to four team members working 100% of their time, the decision to use a project team that was not 100% dedicated to the project would likely lead to task switching penalties, which would reduce productivity and velocity for both projects. Running projects sequentially instead of concurrently would allow each project to run with a team of five fully dedicated team members. With such a team, the velocity can be higher, and the project can be completed ahead of schedule freeing up the project team to complete the second project. While in some cases, the timing of projects is not discretionary for a variety of reasons, still, whenever possible, running projects that use the same project resources sequentially rather than concurrently is more efficient and, in this case, would have likely prevented the situation from happening the first place.<br/>Running projects sequentially instead of concurrently means that the project team members would not have been dedicating a portion of their time working on the other project. A fully dedicated project team is more productive due to a reduction in task switching penalties.<br/>Having a larger team with a lower percentage of time dedicated to the project would likely have increased task switching penalties and reduced productivity. This approach would not be much different from having a team of five members working 75% of their time on the current project.<br/>Agile best practices call for the use of generalizing specialists (scrum developers in the scenario provided) over the use of subject matter experts. Generalizing specialists have greater flexibility in work assignments, which improves efficiency and productivity.<br/></p></div></div></div></div><br/>

In this situation, the project manager does not follow these guidelines by allowing the meeting to go over the 15-minute timebox as well as reprimanding the team members for slow progress, thus forcing the daily standup to become a traditional status meeting. Those who have mainly worked in a predictive environment may tend to fall into this antipattern since they used to get a status from the team members. To ensure that the next daily standup meeting does not fall into this trap, the project manager should empower the team and organize around its strengths. The project manager may want to let the team members facilitate the standup so that the meeting is used as a time for the team to self-organize and make commitments to each other.<br/>While setting the alarm to a predefined interval may help in adhering to one of the ground rules of the daily standup, this action is unlikely to address the main reason the standup turned into a status meeting.<br/>Project managers who have traditionally worked in a predictive environment are used to getting status from the team members. Therefore, switching the development life cycle from adaptive to predictive will only reinforce the meeting to become status rather than standup. Additionally, the life cycle is typically not switched in the middle of a project.<br/>Agile encourages teams to be self-organizing and self-directing. Having a team member to facilitate the standup instead of the project manager will promote and strengthen this practice.<br/></p></div></div></div></div><br/>

Switching the project management approach midway into project execution is not always feasible or advisable. However, unless stated otherwise in the scenario, the project manager, in consultation with the team and relevant stakeholders, is free to choose any approach that would work better than the one currently employed. When agile practices are incorporated into a traditionally managed project, the approach becomes hybrid. With agile methods, various work streams, such as new features, change requests, defect repairs are typically combined into a single backlog that can be reprioritized and managed as a single-list-of-work-and-changes artifact. This approach would provide the project manager and stakeholders an easier way to manage and control project work, perform change control, and validate scope.<br/>Management reserves are indeed used to cover the costs of unknown unknowns. However, any project should anticipate some number of new features, change requests, and defect repairs. While their number is unknown, the fact these work streams will be present over the course of the project life cycle is almost a sure thing.<br/>Delegating responsibilities to team members can be a good approach. However, hiring additional team members solely for the purpose of managing specific processes does not seem to be the wisest and/or the most effective way of using project resources. Additionally, the scenario suggests the problem is not related to the lack of resources.<br/>It is true that predictive projects, such as the one described in the scenario, try to minimize the number of changes. However, limiting the number of new features, change requests, and defect repairs 'allowed' on the project, even one managed traditionally, sounds like an unreasonable approach.<br/></p></div></div></div></div><br/>

There are many tools and techniques at our disposal to make our best guesses and work diligently to fall within those boundaries. Whether your project is agile, traditional, or, as in the scenario described hybrid, working with budgets and day-to-day fluctuations demands tracking and oversight. Hence, the best course of action is to monitor the situation and control it accordingly within the established organizational and project governance guidelines. This approach would provide you with the data to support the variations and work with the relevant stakeholders to make adjustments as necessary.<br/>The earned value management (EVM) formulas are suitable for any project type, including hybrid projects. The EVM seeks to monitor and control the budget over the course of the project. The information derived from the EVM analysis can be used to adjust as necessary. However, adjusting the EVM formulas themselves would be improper.<br/>The variations may or may not be within the cost tolerances asked of the project. The annual timing of the budget does not erase the need to monitor the budget variations. Based on those cost variations, the project team can work with governance to adjust as or if necessary.<br/>The project management methodology used by the project team does not directly guarantee the leveling of budget variations. Even if the leveling was achieved by stopping the agile ceremonies, the objectives and outcomes of the project might supersede the variations of the budget over the year.<br/></p></div></div></div></div><br/>

Therefore, if the project manager wants to formalize the authority assigned to her and gain commitment and acceptance for the project, the best thing for the project manager to do of the choices provided is to obtain approval for the project charter from the sponsor.<br/>The scenario states that the project manager wants to formalize the authority that has been assigned to her implying that the authority has not yet been formalized, i.e., the project charter has not yet been approved. If the charter has not yet been approved, there is nothing to inform the stakeholders about.<br/>An implementation approach based on high-level risks, assumptions, and constraints established on the current environment, organizational factors, and historical data may be proposed as part of the business case. The implementation approach will not formalize the project manager's authority on the project and therefore is not the best answer.<br/>An approved project charter is a document that formally authorizes the existence of a project and provides the project manager with the authority to apply organizational resources to project activities. One of the benefits of an approved charter is that it shows the company's commitment and acceptance of the project.

In other words, the question is asking to identify the project characteristics that are typical of a predictive model. With a traditional waterfall project, the project requirements and scope are typically determined during initial project planning. Once the project management plan is approved, changes are constrained through a robust change management process. The product or result of the project is then typically delivered in its final form at the end of the project. The incorrect answer choices are indicative of agile project management methodologies.<br/>This answer choice describes constraint-driven delivery. Constraint-driven delivery is a characteristic of the Dynamic Systems Development Method (DSDM), which is an agile project management delivery framework. A predictive model will typically hold the project scope as fixed, but allow time and cost to vary.<br/>In projects led with the traditional (predictive) project management approach, the requirements and project scope are typically determined during initial project planning before execution begins. Therefore, this choice represents one of the correct answers.<br/>This answer choice describes a project that employes an agile project management framework. With that approach, delivery occurs frequently with customer-valued subsets of the overall product. With a predictive model, like the one described in the scenario, delivery typically occurs at the end of the project. If there are any interim deliverables, they will be infrequent and major in nature.<br/></p></div></div></div></div><br/>

</div></div> </div></div></div><div class='answer'><a class='ans' onclick='showHide(643)'>Ans</a><p style='display:none;' id='ans_643'>4--Closing a project encompasses a lot of activities. One is to celebrate the hard work and success of the project team. If funds are available and allocated to an event to thank the project team for meeting their objective, then the project manager should honor that announced, scheduled, and promised event. According to the scenario, the cost savings have been added to the contingency reserves which is a common practice when opportunities are captured and resulting in cost savings. Celebrating success is an example of a meeting that can be used among the tools and techniques of the Close Project or Phase process described in this scenario.<br/>

We are often asked about the practice of adding cost savings to contingency reserves. According to the reference provided, page 265, as work on the project progresses, contingency reserves may be used as planned to cover the cost of risk responses or other contingencies. Conversely, when opportunities are captured and resulting in cost saving, funds may be added to the contingency amount, or taken from the project as margin/profit. The scenario describes a project in which costs have been saved thanks to the project coming in under budget and exactly on schedule. According to the scenario, it has been decided to add funds (that represent these cost savings) to the contingency amount to cover the cost of the party. In other words, in this particular project, the decision has been made to add funds to contingency reserve rather than take them from the project as margin profit. And since these funds have been allocated for the party, spending them on the party as planned is the best answer to the question asked.<br/> Adding additional features or functionality beyond what has been scoped and delivered is considered scope creep, unnecessary, and could potentially be wasteful. Project managers are responsible for delivering per requirements and expectations, nothing more.<br/>In most circumstances allocating the funds back to the organization is expected, but in this case, some of those funds were allocated to the project team to honor their success.<br/>The customer signed an agreement for the project to be completed by the project manager's organization. There is not enough information in the question to determine if cost savings are supposed to be given to the customer.<br/></p></div></div></div></div><br/>

</div></div> </div></div></div><div class='answer'><a class='ans' onclick='showHide(644)'>Ans</a><p style='display:none;' id='ans_644'>2--Working agreements are typically part of a team charter. A team charter is a project document that establishes the team values, agreements, and operating guidelines for the team. In traditional projects, a team charter is often one of the outputs of the Plan Resource Management process. In agile projects, this document is created before the beginning of the first iteration or at the earliest possible moment when the team is formed. Conducting a workshop is an excellent method for creating effective working agreements. This method encourages team participation and collaboration so that the team members can gain consensus on the content of the document. The workshop can also serve as a positive team-building exercise for a newly formed agile team.<br/>Typically, working agreements are limited in number so that the team can focus on the most important and valuable ground rules/agreements that they want to emphasize and enforce. Too many agreements/rules may lead to a situation, in which the team members lose their focus and interest and eventually do not abide by any of the rules.<br/>Creating working agreements is best done before the team begins the development of the product so that clear expectations regarding acceptable behavior by the team members are set. Having the team attend a workshop would provide an additional benefit of team-building and collaboration, especially if the team has just been formed.<br/>Working agreements help teams carry out day-to-day work and resolve conflicts when they arise. Having working agreements in place would benefit any team regardless of whether the team is self-organizing or not.<br/></p></div></div></div></div><br/>

There are many factors to consider while carrying out this process. Some of them include staff motivation, number of resources, the law of diminishing returns, and advances in technology. Political awareness is not among these factors. Political awareness refers to the recognition of power relationships, and the willingness to operate within these structures. Political awareness may help the project manager to plan and manage communications, manage and monitor stakeholder engagement, and manage project knowledge. However, among the choices provided, political awareness is the least likely factor to be considered as part of the Estimate Activity Resources process and is, therefore, the best answer to the question asked.<br/>When estimating activity durations, the project manager should be aware of staff motivation and consider how quickly and well a team member would perform the project activity. A poorly motivated team member might procrastinate, take too long at a task, or make mistakes that would affect the activity duration.<br/>A project manager needs to understand the number of resources involved in a project activity since this number would affect the activity duration. At times, adding more resources helps to shorten time to complete a task. However, at some point, adding too many resources to the activity may increase the activity duration due to additional time spent on knowledge transfer, learning, coordination, etc.<br/>The law of diminishing returns is a principle in economics that states that in a production process, adding more of one factor in production (such as labor, capital, resource, technology, or overtime), while holding all other factors constant, at some point, will yield a lower incremental return. Thus, the law of diminishing returns should be considered when activity durations are estimated.<br/></p></div></div></div></div><br/>

Emotional intelligence (EI), and its corresponding metric emotional intelligence quotient (EQ) is different from traditional intelligence or just being ‘smart'. It is considered the ability to understand your own emotions and the emotions of others in order to interact successfully with them on your projects, especially agile projects where interpersonal communication and collaboration is of the utmost importance. Emotional intelligence also includes the capacity to reason about emotions in order to enhance thinking. The benefits of learning these emotional intelligence traits, and they can be learned, is that they allow agile leaders to motivate better, lead, collaborate, and negotiate with team members and stakeholders.<br/>Servant leadership is a set of agile strategies and practices that is founded on the goal of serving other project team members and stakeholders first, and in doing so effectively determining and meeting the needs of these project team members and stakeholders in order to benefit them.

However, only one answer choice can be selected. Always look for the 'best' answer even when the question does not explicitly ask for this. In the scenario described, the project manager, risk owner, and project team member all share responsibility for the failure to complete the execution of the risk response. However, even though others share responsibility, the project manager is ‘ultimately’ responsible, or, in other words, accountable, for the achievement of the project objectives. The project manager can delegate tasks and assignments but cannot delegate the accountability for ensuring that those tasks and assignments are completed. Therefore, of the available choices, saying that the project manager is accountable for ensuring the implementation of the risk response plan is the best answer to the question asked.<br/>The risk owner certainly shares some of the blame for the lack of execution of the risk response plan. However, the project manager and not the risk owner is ultimately responsible, or accountable, for all aspects of the project including the implementation of risk responses. Even though the risk owner was assigned responsibility for implementing the risk response, it is the project manager's responsibility to ensure that assigned tasks are completed.<br/>Even though others share responsibility for the lack of execution on the implementation of the risk response, the project manager is ultimately responsible, or accountable, for the achievement of the project objectives.<br/>It is unknown from the question whether or not the project sponsor was informed of the issue or the steps being taken in response. Even if the project sponsor was aware, it is not the responsibility nor the accountability of the project sponsor to implement response plans (unless the sponsor is the identified risk owner which is unlikely to be the case) or ensure that the others involved in the project perform their assigned tasks. Rather, the project sponsor is responsible for the project funding and supporting the project manager when issues cannot be handled with the authority of the project manager.<br/></p></div></div></div></div><br/>

</div></div> </div></div></div><div class='answer'><a class='ans' onclick='showHide(649)'>Ans</a><p style='display:none;' id='ans_649'>2--As stated by the author in the reference, ""The duration of a project is not estimated as much as it is derived by taking the total number of story points and dividing it by the velocity of the team."" Velocity can be roughly estimated at the beginning of the project if the project uses the same team, same (or similar) technologies, and other team and project attributes that are the same or similar to the previously completed projects. If the velocity cannot be estimated based on those factors, it should be observed during the first two to three iterations, assuming the project constraints allow for this ""waiting period"". Once the velocity is established and the total amount of the story points is known, this amount can be divided by the current team's velocity to arrive at how many iterations it will take for the team to complete the project work. Iterations are time-boxed intervals, for example, two weeks. With the number of iterations known, the team will be able to tell how long the project will take. For example, with ten 2-week iterations, the project duration will be 20 weeks.<br/>Bottom-up estimating is typically used on traditionally managed projects by aggregating the estimates of the lower-level components of the WBS. Note that tasks, let alone the duration of the tasks comprising the user stories, is not yet known at this stage of the project.<br/>Velocity is usually known after the team has run a few iterations (typically two to three). Dividing the total amount of story points by velocity would result in the number of iterations required to complete the project. With a time-boxed iteration length (for example, 2 weeks), the estimated project duration can then be calculated.<br/>Velocity is not something that can be calculated. Velocity can be either estimated based on historical values from previous similar projects or observed based on the team performance up to date.<br/></p></div></div></div></div><br/>

In this case, the risk response of replacing a team member introduced the secondary risk of the team member disrupting the cohesiveness of the high performing team represented by the team reverting to the storming stage of team development. Thus, the team falling behind schedule is the result of the secondary risk posed by the introduction a new member to the team. One cannot assume that a newly hired team member will be able to replace a member of a high performing team without some disruption. The project manager should have anticipated this secondary risk and developed an appropriate risk response. For example, the project manager could have included schedule reserves during project planning to address this secondary risk, which may have prevented the project from falling behind schedule. Therefore, of the choices provided, identifying the secondary risk and developing a response plan to address it could have helped avoid the situation described in the scenario.<br/>Residual risk is the risk that remains after risk responses have been implemented. Although residual risk may or may not have been a factor in this case, the risks associated with the implementation of the risk response by introducing a new member to a high performing team is best described as a secondary risk. In this scenario, the secondary risk is more likely to be the cause of the project running behind schedule rather than any residual risk.<br/>Contingency reserves are established to address known risks. According to the scenario, the planned risk response has been implemented implying contingency reserves have been established and were sufficient.<br/>The risk that the new team member might not perform as well as the original team member, or disrupt the cohesiveness of a high performing team, should have been anticipated by the project manager.

The number of projects affected and the degree of impact is going to vary. Hence, before any changes to the project and the product backlog are made, the project manager and project team must assess the differences between the current project plans and completed product increments to the proposed new plans. Controlling the scope may take on different forms depending on the project management approach (predictive, agile, hybrid) as well as evaluations and discussions amongst all stakeholders. It may be determined that the changes are so grand that it is better to cancel the current project and start a new one. So before any work is added to the current project, assessment of the business strategy and what the current project has done and can do is the first action to take.<br/>Adding the new features to the product backlog without first evaluating their impact on all project constraints is a premature action. On agile projects, specifically, the product backlog is managed by the product owner. You, as a project manager, are not supposed to add new items to the product backlog at will without, at least, talking to the product owner.<br/>Evaluation of the requested changes compared to the work already planned and completed provides a project manager an opportunity to assess the degree to which the current product backlog will have to be changed. Technically, this evaluation will have to be done by the product owner and the project team. You, as a project manager, will have to facilitate this activity.<br/>The project manager does not need to sit on their hands awaiting direction and instructions from senior management.

Involving the sponsors, customers, and other stakeholders during project initiation creates a shared understanding of success criteria. This course of action also increases the likelihood of deliverables acceptance when the project is complete, as well as improves stakeholder satisfaction throughout the project. Agile leaders have to analyze the current organizational culture, policies and procedures and determine those that impede a team's or organization's agility. Once these factors are identified, working to streamline them would be the next step for the agile leader. In the scenario described, the organization requires that every project has to produce extensive documentation. The product owner feels these requirements are unjustifiable and would reduce the value delivered to the customer, thus negatively impacting the benefits the organization could have had if the team spent more time developing the product. The project manager, as an agile servant leader, may assist the product owner by creating a shared understanding with all stakeholders involved about how agile deliverables meet those documentation requirements. The project manager can then go ahead and evaluate the amount of documentation required so the team spends more time delivering a valuable product instead of producing exhaustive documentation.<br/>Building a shared understanding among the stakeholders regarding the deliverables required by the project would set mutual expectations among all parties involved: the organization, customer, team, product owner, and the project manager. Delivering a reasonable balance between the product and its documentation would be the preferred solution.<br/>Choices with absolute statements, such as ""always"", ""never"", ""any"", etc., typically represent incorrect answers. Requesting not to include 'any' user stories to cover documents writing would be an extreme response. This course of action would also go against the current organizational policies and procedures.<br/> First, there is not enough information in the scenario to determine if three iterations would be enough to produce the required documentation. Second, postponing product development to later iterations increases project risk, because in agile, the sooner the team identifies issues, the better the chances of risks being exposed and addressed.<br/></p></div></div></div></div><br/>

However, people cannot be forced to share what they know.

However, having a Kanban board to manage the workflow implies the project incorporates agile elements, making the overarching approach hybrid. The scenario suggests that the project team members are not applying the same standards for when the work items are complete and ready to advance to the next stage on the Kanban board. The team's working agreements should define when work is ready for the next stage. This situation suggests that either the project team needs to be reminded of their existing working agreements, or the working agreements are not clear on the definitions for ready and done. The project manager should first review the team's working agreements with the project team members to see if that clears up any misunderstandings. If the working agreements are unclear, then the project manager may facilitate a team discussion to revise the team's social contract.<br/>Once the dispute is resolved, it might be a good idea to document any best practices in the lessons learned register. However, at this point, all that is known is that there is a conflict between the team members around the definition of done. There would be little (if any) useful information to be recorded in the lessons learned register at this point.<br/>The on-demand scheduling approach has likely been selected for a reason and documented in the schedule management plan. Replacing this approach with a traditional Gantt chart without understanding the cause behind the issue described in the scenario would be an unwarranted and premature decision.<br/>The team charter should contain the project team's working agreements.

The completion date must be met. One needs to use a formula for the EAC that considers both the SPI and the CPI. This formula is EAC = AC + [(BAC - EV) / (CPI x SPI)]. The EV is not provided and therefore has to be obtained using the formula CPI = EV / AC. The details of the calculation are below:

EV = AC x CPI = 40 x 0.92 = 36.8

EAC = AC + [(BAC - EV) / (CPI x SPI)] = 40 + [(50 – 36.8) / (0.92 x 0.8)]= 40 + [13.2 / 0.736] = 40 + 17.94 = 57.94<br/>The formula used for this answer is EAC = BAC / CPI. This formula is used when the CPI is expected to be the same for the remainder of the project. However, in this scenario, you do not necessarily expect CPI to be the same for the remainder of the project. Since there is no flexibility on the project completion date, an equation that includes the SPI must be used.<br/>In this scenario, there is no flexibility on the scheduled completion date. Therefore, the CPI and SPI influence the remaining work. The correct formula is EAC = AC+ [(BAC-EV) / (CPI x SPI)].<br/>The formula used for this answer is EAC = AC + BAC - EV. This formula is used when the present cost variance was only a one-time event, and the future work will be accomplished at the planned rate.

Nonetheless, there are budgetary challenges that every project, regardless of the project management approach selected, must address. The larger the scope and the greater the length of a project, the more interdependencies and budget challenges the project may encounter throughout its life cycle. While, according to the scenario, the product of the project will be developed in two-week iterations, the question is asking about addressing the 'longer-term' budget challenges. Therefore, for this hybrid multi-year project, facilitating quarterly reviews of the budget would make the most sense in analyzing the current state as well as exploring and forecasting potential future budget challenges.<br/>The blend of various project management methodologies requires the project team to leverage long term strategies of meeting quarterly to examine and address the budget requirements of the project. The shorter two-week cycles are not sufficient in addressing larger, more complex, budgetary challenges and project interdependencies.<br/>The issue with the budget in this hybrid project is not the lack of constraints. As such, there is little advantage of injecting more constraints to the budget as the project progresses. Tracking budgetary challenges is a good practice, but not within the constraining measures.<br/>The project budget does not get used equally and consumed over the project life cycle. The rate of how the budget is used is typically an S-curve in traditional projects. In a hybrid project, the rate differs. Basing the consumption of the budget on a steady per-iteration rate is most likely not feasible unless the expenditures are consistent and predictable.<br/></p></div></div></div></div><br/>

</div></div> </div></div></div><div class='answer'><a class='ans' onclick='showHide(662)'>Ans</a><p style='display:none;' id='ans_662'>4--Predictive and agile project life cycles differ from one another in several aspects. One of them is the way cost and risk are controlled. Predictive projects develop detailed plans up-front, including the cost baseline and risk responses. The risk responses are planned with the allocated contingency reserves that are part of the cost baseline. Then, as the project progresses, the actual costs are compared to the cost baseline, and variances, if found, are controlled using dedicated tools and techniques. Agile projects, on the other hand, adapt almost in real-time as new requirements and constraints emerge. The most typical way for an agile project to control cost and risk is to update the product backlog with the new information and re-prioritize the backlog based on the highest value for the customer, thus resulting in a risk-adjusted backlog. Everything in between falls under the hybrid project life cycle category. With hybrid project life cycles, the product can be divided into subsets, which are delivered at either pre-defined intervals or as soon as the subsets are completed. Plans are created for these product subsets and are then further elaborated with the new information as it becomes available, which, in turn, allows to control cost and risk accordingly.<br/>Adhering to the cost baseline and implementing risk responses is a typical approach to control cost and risk on projects that are lead using the predictive project management approach. Hybrid projects, like the one described in the scenario, use more flexible methods.<br/>The approach to control cost and risk described in this answer choice is usually taken on agile projects. New requirements and constraints that emerge as the project progresses are evaluated, incorporated into the product backlog, and prioritized according to the customer value.<br/>While cost baseline is a sign that the project is likely managed using a predictive approach, increasing the cost baseline for each newly identified risk is a flawed practice. New risks should first be evaluated, and responses planned. However, not every risk response requires a contingency reserve that would result in an increase in the cost baseline.<br/></p></div></div></div></div><br/>

</div></div> </div></div></div><div class='answer'><a class='ans' onclick='showHide(665)'>Ans</a><p style='display:none;' id='ans_665'>2--Inaccurate estimate is a common occurrence in any project, whether traditional or agile. When a user story is underestimated during iteration planning, the result might be similar to what is described in the scenario - a team member realizes that she cannot complete the work within the time-box allocated for the iteration. The simplest and straightforward approach is splitting the user story. Therefore, of the choices provided, suggesting to split the user story is the best answer to the question asked.<br/>

However, for those who want to know a bit more about splitting user stories, it's worth mentioning that splitting a user story is not always possible. Splitting user stories can typically be done for two reasons: the story either compound or it is complex. An example of a compound user story is a module that accepts credit card payments for four major card types, with two of the card types that account for 85% of end-users and require 50% of the coding effort. Writing the code for the credit card types that account for the majority of the users should come first. The rest 15% can be done in the upcoming iterations. In this case, slices related to this user story bring value to the customer, and therefore, the team would be credited for completing the slices in each iteration where the slices are implemented.<br/>

A complex user story is a different situation. A complex user story cannot be logically split into several stories with their own value. A complex user story is just one big story that carries its value only when it's fully completed. Therefore, completing just one or several slices of such a user story would not bring value to the customer. Going with the same credit card example, let's assume that developing a payment with one credit card is a very big user story that cannot be completed in one iteration. Therefore, the story should be split. However, completing one or more of its slices in the current iteration would not bring value to the customer and thus would not credit the team for their work on those slices. Only after all slices of the story are completed in the upcoming iteration(s), will the value be delivered and the team credited for their work.<br/>Encouragement from the team members is a positive sign. However, this course of action would not resolve the issue in the first place. The developer clearly states that the user story is too big to be completed in the iteration. Therefore, by merely encouraging the developer without providing any concrete solutions, the work is unlikely to be completed.<br/>If the story is complex and cannot be completed within the time-box of one iteration, the story should be split. Whether the story should be replaced with another one, or should the developer consult with the team only or with the team and the product owner, whether the splitting should be done immediately or during the next iteration planning, is a different question. In the context of the current scenario, of the choices provided, this option is the best answer.<br/>There is not enough information in the question suggesting that this user story has a higher value than the others. Therefore, while swarming on the story may or may not help in completing it, swarming would cause the teammates to be taken away from their own tasks, tasks that might actually deliver more value than this particular story.<br/></p></div></div></div></div><br/>

This is especially beneficial in situations, like in this question, where the project team and the selected seller must work in tandem to develop a series of products and the underpinning services. Establishing a partnership with the supplier is a good practice. Setting and maintaining a certain set of quality standards for a project and the project's procurement needs over the length of the project is essential to ensure constant and reliable quality and healthy working relationships with the seller.<br/>The assumption should not be that the seller is to constantly provide poor quality or incomplete work. The project team and the supplier must work together to ensure the requirements and the quality standards are understood and adhered to. Forcing the seller to deliver early with the assumption the deliverables do not meet expectations erodes trust between buyer and seller.<br/> Reducing the measurements and quality metrics does not increase quality without a compelling reason as to why and how. Metrics are a means to check and assure quality. Conducting fewer checks does not equate to higher quality.<br/>Tightening quality standards at selected points may be needed, as long as all parties are cognizant of those changes and why those standards fall within the terms and conditions of the agreement. Changing the standards to see if the seller is staying aware of conditions is not an effective buyer-seller relationship.<br/></p></div></div></div></div><br/>

Documenting an agreement on ownership of the costs and the priorities to ensure ongoing benefit realization of the product better equips the project team to more appropriately handle the procurement needs and deliver value throughout the project life cycle.<br/> The price of the materials should not set the priority of purchasing new project materials unless this is formally agreed upon by all parties. The higher cost of materials does not necessarily equate to a higher priority.<br/> Priority may drive many of the decisions as to which materials to procure. Nonetheless, the ownership of costs is not to be placed solely on the stakeholder with the highest priority and nearest term needs. The ownership of project costs is not equal to procurement priority.<br/>Facilitating and documenting an agreement regarding the purchasing and the priority of the procurement needs with all parties ensures alignment on the project. This documentation communicates the handling of procurement for ongoing benefit realization.<br/></p></div></div></div></div><br/>

Projects may be canceled for a variety of reasons that have nothing to do with the actual performance of the project. For example, new technology might become available that renders the project's deliverables obsolete. Even though the project has been terminated early, the project manager should still perform all of the activities associated with the Close Project or Phase process. In this case, performing a project retrospective will be particularly important to understand and document the reasons for the project's cancellation. After the project retrospective, the lessons learned register should be finalized and transferred to the lessons learned repository as an organizational process asset.<br/>

Note, the scenario says that the project has been terminated due to the 'exit criteria' being met as defined in the project charter. Exit criteria are not the same as success criteria. Success criteria are a subset of the exit criteria. The scenario implies the project has been terminated prematurely.<br/>Even though the project has been terminated prematurely before completion, a project retrospective should be conducted to gather and document any final lessons learned from the project, which can then be added to the organizational process assets.<br/>Releasing the project team members is an activity associated with the project's closure. However, there are still activities that need to be completed as part of the Close Project or Phase process, and at least some of the project team members will need to be available to perform those tasks. Releasing all of the project team members would be among the last activities performed for project closure.<br/>The lessons learned register should be marked as the final version and transferred to the lessons learned repository as an organizational process asset during project closure. However, the project manager should first collect any final lessons learned for inclusion in the lessons learned register.

</div></div> </div></div></div><div class='answer'><a class='ans' onclick='showHide(672)'>Ans</a><p style='display:none;' id='ans_672'>4--An information radiator is a visible display that provides information to the rest of the organization enabling up-to-the-minute knowledge sharing without having to disturb the team. A burndown chart is an example of the information radiator that can indicate the progress of a project at a glance. A release burndown chart is typically updated after every iteration, while an iteration burndown chart is updated daily. A burndown chart shows the actual and estimated amount of work to be achieved over time, and is a good indicator of both progress, potential finish dates, and if the team is on target for completing the work based on estimates. Burndown charts are often placed in high-traffic, highly visible locations, so anyone interested can quickly see at a glance the project status. Agile methods seek to minimize documentation that has to be maintained, updated, and distributed such as progress reports in favor of information radiators that can radiate information like project status to a large audience who may not have the expertise required to interpret sophisticated dashboards or scheduling tools.<br/>

Note, the reason the scenario indicates that the company is small and is occupying one floor in an office building is given to allow the reader to understand that inviting the senior manager once a month to review the information radiators is a feasible option. In large companies, especially with geographically distributed project teams, this course of action would not always be possible. Some exam questions, however, do not indicate the specifics of the organization. In those circumstances, reasonable assumptions should be made and, of the choices provided, the best answer to the question asked should be selected.<br/>Agile projects do not create standard project status reports used in traditional projects to report progress. Instead, agile practitioners use information radiators to track project progress and inform the project team, customers, and stakeholders about the project status.<br/>The daily standup is a meeting that is held by the team members to synchronize their work and report any impediments to progress. Project status and estimated completion date are not presented during this meeting. Daily standups are typically not open for attendance by customers, stakeholders, or members of management.<br/>In agile projects, the demonstration of a product increment typically takes place at the iteration review meeting. While demonstrating product increments monthly for the senior manager can be done, this approach is neither completely aligned with agile practices, nor will it provide the project status and/or completion date to the manager.<br/></p></div></div></div></div><br/>

It can be assumed you are the intended project manager if the project gets approved. However, this information is not required to answer this question. The key to correctly answering this question is identifying that the question stipulates that pre-project work is being done for a potential project. The project artifacts that might be created as part of pre-project work include the needs assessment, business case, and benefits management plan. The benefits management plan is the documented explanation defining the processes for creating, maximizing, and sustaining the benefits provided by a project or program. One element of the benefits management plan is the timeframe for benefits realization. Incorporating incremental delivery of project deliverables will allow the project to benefit from the early realization of value as opposed to completing all of the project deliverables before implementation. In this scenario, that might include modernizing components of the production line incrementally so benefits can be realized faster. Incorporating agile elements into a predictive project makes the project life cycle hybrid.<br/>If an agile framework is used for the project, it will be important to have a prioritized backlog, so the aspects of the project that deliver the most value are created first. However, the question stipulates that the project is still in the pre-project stage, implying the product backlog is not even available.<br/>The work breakdown structure (WBS) is created during the Create WBS process, which is part of project planning. The question describes a project that is not even in initiation. According to the scenario, pre-project work is being carried out. Planning comes later, assuming the project is approved.<br/>The benefits management plan can include the timeframe for realizing benefits. Incremental delivery, one of agile best practices, can accelerate benefits realization, thus addressing the sponsor's request of delivering value in the form of efficiency gains as quickly as possible.<br/></p></div></div></div></div><br/>

As a result, the customer gets the product they envisioned, the customer is satisfied, and the project is a success.<br/>Although pair programming is one of the agile best practices, especially in projects where the team is using the eXtreme Programming (XP) software development methods, pair programming alone would not guarantee the success of the project.<br/>While doing refactoring and continuous integration would help the team to build a better-quality product, refactoring and continuous integration alone would not necessarily result in the product that was required by the customer. If the product is not what the customer wanted, it is obvious that the customer won't be satisfied.<br/>Conducting the daily standup meetings and owning the code collectively are part of agile best practices. However, exercising these practices is different from building the right product as envisioned by the customer. Customer satisfaction is typically achieved by building the right product rather than having the right process to develop the product.<br/></p></div></div></div></div><br/>

</div></div> </div></div></div><div class='answer'><a class='ans' onclick='showHide(676)'>Ans</a><p style='display:none;' id='ans_676'>3--The question states that the project manager has assigned tasks to the team members. If you missed this detail in the first sentence of the scenario, you would likely answer this question incorrectly. The reason being is that in agile projects, tasks are not assigned to specific individuals. At the start of an iteration, the team members assign tasks to themselves based on their experience, skills, preferences, and other considerations. Then, based on the progress of the whole team against the entire set of tasks representing the iteration backlog, the team decides on the best approach to complete the remained tasks. New tasks are not started until previously selected ones are completed.<br/>

In the reference cited, Mike Cohn states, ""There is nothing to gain and quite a bit to lose by assigning individuals to specific tasks during iteration planning. Projects do best when they foster a 'we are all in this together' attitude – when team members pick up slack for each other knowing that the favor will be returned. When individuals sign up for specific tasks at the beginning of the iteration, it works against fostering a unified commitment to achieving the goals of the iteration."" Agile encourages cooperation among the team members to set ground rules and internal processes that foster team coherence and strengthen team members' commitment to shared outcomes.<br/>It may sound reasonable to have all but one task unfinished comparing to having one task done and multiple tasks incomplete. However, there is not enough information in the scenario to determine what tasks have the highest priority. Also, the refusal to help their teammate is not entirely aligned with agile collaboration values.<br/>The way this answer choice is worded makes it sound too extreme. First, team members are not 'obliged' to help their colleagues. Helping each other is aspiration and good agile practice. Expected or encouraged to help would sound better than obliged. Second, help should not be offered at 'any' cost.<br/>This is true: on agile projects, tasks are not assigned to team members. Rather, the team members choose what task they can accomplish based on various criteria and team agreements, and then work as a team towards the iteration goal.<br/></p></div></div></div></div><br/>

</div></div> </div></div></div><div class='answer'><a class='ans' onclick='showHide(677)'>Ans</a><p style='display:none;' id='ans_677'>3--An information radiator is a highly visible graphical representation of project information that allows agile teams to communicate the status of the project progress to the project stakeholders. Information radiators are typically displayed in high-traffic, easily accessible areas to enable maximum visibility and transparency of the project performance information. The scenario indicates that everybody is located in the same office space, and the sponsor likes to come by to the team space every day to see how the project progresses. The reason for the scenario to be framed in this way is to present a situation in which the project team likely uses information radiators to share project progress with stakeholders, including the sponsor. When a stakeholder is unable to access the information radiators for whatever reason, the best way to keep the stakeholder updated is to take a picture of the information radiators and send it to the stakeholder. Of the choices provided, this course of action is likely the easiest, the least wasteful (does not require an additional effort to create duplicate project reports), and most effective way of communicating the project status to the sponsor.<br/>

Note, ideally, asking the sponsor on the preferred communication way of providing the project status update would be a better answer choice. However, this option is not provided.<br/>Having a conversation with the sponsor is a good idea. However, a typical agile project would have information radiators to communicate status in a speedy and visual way. If, after sharing the information radiators with the sponsor (e.g., via email), there are still questions left, then a phone conversation would be a good option.<br/> Projects that are managed using agile best practices, communicate project status using information radiators. Creating a slideshow and/or spreadsheets to duplicate the same information for the sake of updating the sponsor is considered waste in agile. There is a better answer choice to address the sponsor's request.<br/>Agile teams are using information radiators to display the project status to all concerned project stakeholders. Taking pictures of the information radiators and sending them to the sponsor via email on a weekly basis is the most straightforward, most effective, and the information-rich way to keep the sponsor up to date.<br/></p></div></div></div></div><br/>

</div></div> </div></div></div><div class='answer'><a class='ans' onclick='showHide(678)'>Ans</a><p style='display:none;' id='ans_678'>3--An important aspect of project management is tailoring the project management methodology to the needs of the project. A predictive approach works well for projects where requirements can be determined upfront. In a project environment where the project requirements are continually evolving, an adaptive approach is suited better. The benefit of adaptive life cycles, such as agile, is that this approach welcomes changes throughout the development life cycle and harnesses change to maximize value for the customer. Had the project manager selected an adaptive approach for the project, the problems described by the question could have likely been avoided. Therefore, it is reasonable to assume that the project manager selected the wrong development life cycle.<br/>

It is likely that a hybrid project management approach would have worked best for this project. A hybrid approach combines elements of traditional projects with those of agile. For example, if the organization wants (for whatever reasons) to manage its projects traditionally, the organization can decide that most of the project processes will be carried out using the predictive project management approach, while the change management will follow agile practices to meet the customer's need of frequently changing requirements. Note, the development approach, e.g., hybrid, is typically documented as an additional component of the project management plan.<br/>Allowing the changes in itself is not wrong, as long as the changes are controlled and not the result of poor planning. In a rapidly changing environment like the one described by the scenario, the project management methodology needs to provide flexibility in order to maximize value to the customer.<br/> The current approach has been proven wrong. Proceeding as planned would only worsen the situation and decrease the chances of the project's success. The project manager should have selected a different development life cycle.<br/>The approach as described in the question is predictive. However, because of the need for rapid changes, a development life cycle that is adaptive, like an agile approach, would be more appropriate.<br/></p></div></div></div></div><br/>

</div></div> </div></div></div><div class='answer'><a class='ans' onclick='showHide(679)'>Ans</a><p style='display:none;' id='ans_679'>3--Projects require resources. Those resources may be acquired in different fashions based on the industry, project objective, and various enterprise environmental factors. How the project is managed does not drastically alter the amount of resources needed to complete the work. There may be differences in the skill sets, timing, and working arrangements. But the scope of previous projects provides a range of expectations to plan the amount of resources potentially needed. Collecting lessons learned and the scope (work) completed by similar projects gives good data to base resource estimates on. Having those estimates gathered from the various project management methods may help the project manager make resource planning decisions for this hybrid project.<br/>Having resources ready to be pulled from is a luxury not expected of projects and project managers. A better project management practice would be to appropriately plan and estimate on when and how many resources the project can expect or manage. Operating in a hybrid manner does not mean a project manager must adjust on the fly and forgo long term resource planning.<br/>Asking for more resources than you may or may not need is a behavior that will be shunned by in almost every project organization. Organizations are not tolerating of project managers who ask for more resources than needed and not utilize them. As a best practice, a project manager should estimate the resources that best match the project requirements and within the organization’s budget.<br/>Hybrid projects utilize the aspects of traditional and agile project management techniques that are best suited for the project. Basing resource estimates on the scope and lessons learned from previous projects within the organization provides this project with an excellent basis to frame its resource estimates.<br/></p></div></div></div></div><br/>

In such situations, a risk escalation strategy can be adopted. Risk escalation is a risk response strategy whereby the team and/or the project manager acknowledges that the risk is outside of their sphere of influence and shifts the ownership of the risk to a higher level of the organization where it is more effectively managed. Escalated risks can be managed at the program level, portfolio level, or other relevant parts of the organization.

Recurring iteration retrospectives regularly check on the effectiveness of the quality processes. They look for the root cause of issues and then suggest trials of new approaches to improve quality. Subsequent retrospectives evaluate any trial processes to determine if they are working and should be continued, adjusted, or dropped from use.

Delays are considered waste. One of the ways to deal with the delays is to reduce work in process (WIP). However, reducing WIP is just a part of the solution. There are situations in which team members work on multiple projects simultaneously. In many cases, while work on one project is on hold due to a dependency (e.g., waiting for information, resources, or materials), the team can work on tasks for another project. Although, working on multiple projects may appear to be a way of maximizing efficiency and resource utilization, overall, especially as the number of projects and tasks increases, there are significant costs associated with delays in communication and inefficiencies incurred in task and context switching. To deal with this situation, lean-agile suggests creating self-directing teams that have all the resources they need (business representatives, developers, testers) who will pull the work items from the prioritized product backlog, communicate with each other or the customer when a question arises, and help each other when a delay is encountered or anticipated.<br/>Detailed project management plans are typically associated with projects that are carried out using the traditional project management approach. The scenario, however, describes an agile project, in which you want to apply some lean-agile concepts to eliminate waste.<br/>The root cause analysis is an analytical technique used to determine the basic underlying reason that causes a variance, defect, or risk. According to the scenario, you have already identified the reasons for the various delays, implying the root cause analysis (or a similar technique) has likely been applied.<br/>Having all the necessary resources on the team, for example, business representatives, developers, testers, will reduce the delays caused by some of the factors described in the question. Business representatives should work with the customer to answer any questions raised by the team members.<br/></p></div></div></div></div><br/>

The fist-of-five voting method is a technique that can be used to gain a consensus for a proposal by the participants. When using this technique, participants indicate their level of support for the proposal or idea by raising a closed fist (indicating no support) to five fingers (indicating full support). If any participant holds up fewer than three fingers, the participant is given the opportunity to voice their concerns regarding the proposal. Once all of the participants raise three or more fingers, a consensus has been reached, and the team can move on to the next decision.<br/>

<br/>With the fist-of-five voting method, holding up five fingers indicates total support for the proposal. Although desirable, getting total support for every estimate is not always possible and/or realistic. The question is asking for sufficient, not total support. Three or more fingers of support for the proposed estimate is sufficient.<br/>The fist-of-five voting method is an example of a decision-making technique that can be used as part of the Estimate Activity Durations process implied by the scenario. With this technique, a consensus is reached when all of the participants raise at least three fingers in support of the proposal.<br/>This answer choice describes the thumbs up/down/sideways voting method rather than the fist-of-five. Also, the question is asking about consensus per each estimate, rather than support for the entire sprint plan<br/></p></div></div></div></div><br/>

Because the question is asking for the current CPI, only the activities (tasks) that should have been completed by the end of October 3rd should be considered, which are the first three activities.<br/>

Since the scenario mentions that the method used to determine the earned value is based on percent complete, the earned value of a partially completed work package is calculated by multiplying the planned value of the work package by its the percent complete. The EV is the sum of the planned work completed for each activity multiplied by the percentage of completion of the corresponding activity, which, in this case, is:

100% for System Analysis
75% for System Design
50% for System Development
EV = (100% * $500) + (75% * $1,000) + (50%  * $5,000) = $500 + $750 + $2,500 = $3,750

The AC is the sum of the costs for the first three activities:

$600 for System Analysis
$500 for System Design
$2,000 for System Development
AC = $600 + $500 + $2,000 = $3,100

Therefore, the CPI can be calculated as:

CPI = EV / AC = $3,750 / $3,100 = 1.21

Since the CPI of 1.21 is greater than 1.0, the project is running under planned costs.<br/>The cost variance (CV) can be calculated as earned value (EV) minus actual costs (AC) which is $650. However, the question is asking for the CPI and not the CV.<br/>The current cost performance index (CPI) can be calculated by dividing current earned value (EV) by the current actual costs (AC). If EV and AC are transposed in the formula, the result is 0.83, making this choice an incorrect answer.<br/>The current cost performance index (CPI) can be calculated by dividing current earned value (EV) by the current actual costs (AC). The EV is the sum of the planned work completed, which, in this case, is 100% of activity 1, 75% of activity 2, and 50% of activity 3. The AC is the sum of the costs for the first three activities. CPI = EV / AC = $3,750 / $3,100 = 1.21. Since the CPI of 1.21 is greater than 1.0, the project is running under planned costs.<br/></p></div></div></div></div><br/>

</div></div> </div></div></div><div class='answer'><a class='ans' onclick='showHide(691)'>Ans</a><p style='display:none;' id='ans_691'>1--Eliminating project risks is an important agile practice. Sometimes, this practice comes at the cost of not building the product increment in every iteration or doing something that the customer does not value, such as reducing technical debt or improving product design. This, in turn, may cause customer and stakeholder dissatisfaction. As stated by the authors in the reference, ""usually the biggest risk is in building what the customer doesn't need. However, there are times when not discovering something about the system now will cause you great problems later (such as a redesign or higher integration costs). In these cases, building what can most mitigate your risks may be more appropriate.""

Ideally, the product owner is the one who defines the iteration backlog and should have known already at the iteration planning meeting that the current iteration was not supposed to deliver any business value. However, the scenario does not provide any specifics as to how the iteration was planned and why the stakeholders have not been informed.<br/>

Note, the way the question is asked, ""What did the scrum master most likely tell the stakeholders?"" may result in any choices to be the correct answer. However, the idea behind this question is not to guess the scrum master's response but to provide the explanation that is aligned with agile best practices.<br/>If the team feels there is a risk on a project, it is better to investigate it now, even at the expense of not delivering any value to the customer in the short term. This course of action is a better approach than waiting until the risk 'explodes' later on and potentially causes the entire project to fail.<br/>Delivering working software frequently, from a couple of weeks to a couple of months, with a preference to the shorter timescale is one of the Agile Manifesto's principles. Therefore, saying that delivering business value in each iteration is not so important would go against agile best practices. When no value is created (such as the case in the scenario provided), the lack of importance should not serve as the underlying reason.<br/>Product increments that are developed during an iteration are demonstrated at the iteration review meeting, not iteration retrospective. An iteration retrospective is a meeting used by the agile teams to reflect and adapt.<br/></p></div></div></div></div><br/>

By only looking at costs by resource, the project manager is not taking into consideration costs for overhead items such as meeting rooms, accounting, legal teams, utilities, etc. If the finance manager is charging these indirect costs to the project, and the project manager has not accounted for these costs, then there will be a discrepancy between the actual project costs and the costs reported by the project manager. Therefore, in this situation, the project manager most likely forgot about the indirect costs.<br/>

The question does not provide specific details as to by how much the actual costs are higher than the planned costs (the cost baseline). There could be many reasons for the actual costs to be higher than the planned costs. Whatever the reason is, not including the indirect costs into the cost baseline makes the variance between the actual costs and planned costs bigger. Therefore, the most likely reason for the actual costs to be higher than the planned costs in this particular scenario with the given set of the answer choices is the indirect costs not being included in the cost baseline.<br/>The question indicates that the project manager has accounted for the resources used on the project including the resource rates and hours. These costs are examples of variable costs. Therefore, the project manager has not just accounted for the fixed costs associated with the project.<br/>By only looking at costs by resource, the project manager is looking only at the direct costs of the project. Indirect costs need to be added as overhead.<br/>Higher than planned costs is not uncommon. However, having higher than planned costs is not considered normal.

Therefore, rather than looking for excuses that the project cannot be completed because of the lack of colocation, project leaders should be creative to maintain the team cohesiveness and sustain the interactions among the team members. Recent advances in technology supply virtual teams with numerous powerful video and teleconferencing tools that provide the team members with a rich multimedia experience, closely mimicking the real office environment. Under the circumstances described in this scenario, providing the team with video and teleconferencing tools to be used daily is the best course of action for the scrum master.<br/>The organization offers its employees the free choice of where to work from.

This practice helps reduce defect rates as issues can be caught and corrected as the code is written.<br/>Creating separate defect repair user stories and adding them to the product backlog is an acceptable agile practice. This approach ensures that defects are repaired. However, this course of action would not help lower the defect rate in the first place since this approach is not proactive.<br/>Agile development methods take advantage of automated testing. Automated testing tools are typically more effective than manual testing. Replacing manual testing with automated testing tools is an effective method of reducing the defect rate, but not the other way around.<br/></p></div></div></div></div><br/>

Plan Stakeholder Engagement is the process of developing approaches to involve project stakeholders based on their needs, expectations, interests, and potential impact on the project. The stakeholder register is one of the inputs to this process. The stakeholder register is typically created during project initiation. The power/interest grid can be used to classify stakeholders according to their level of authority (power) and level of concern about the project's outcomes (interest). According to the scenario, the project sponsor's authority is high, which translates to high power; however, the sponsor's level of concern about the project's outcomes is insufficient, which means the sponsor's interest in the project is low. This means the project sponsor's classification will be displayed at the top-left quadrant of the power/interest grid.<br/>

Note, ideally, the project sponsor should have both the power and interest at their high level, i.e., the project sponsor's classification should be displayed at the top-right quadrant of the power/interest grid.<br/>Quadrant A represents stakeholders with a high level of authority (power) and a low level of concern about the project's outcomes (interest). In the scenario, the project sponsor is described as a stakeholder with a high level of authority (high power) but an insufficient level of concern about the project's outcomes (low interest). This classification is aligned with the top-left quadrant of the power/interest grid, making this choice the best answer to the question asked.<br/>Quadrant B represents stakeholders with a high level of authority (power) and a high level of concern about the project's outcomes (interest). In the scenario, the project sponsor is described as a stakeholder with a high level of authority (high power) but an insufficient level of concern about the project's outcomes (low interest). This classification falls into quadrant A, not B.<br/>Quadrant C represents stakeholders with a low level of authority (power) and a low level of concern about the project's outcomes (interest). In the scenario, the project sponsor is described as a stakeholder with a high level of authority (high power) but an insufficient level of concern about the project's outcomes (low interest). This classification falls into quadrant A, not C.<br/></p></div></div></div></div><br/>

Control project work is about determining what, if any, action is needed to correct or prevent any variance in the project plan. In this scenario, the project manager has learned of a variance that will affect the project's ability to meet the approved scope which in this case is the radio tower with a 75-mile range instead of the required 100-miles range. By submitting a change request, the project manager is ensuring that only official changes are made to the scope and, when approved by the authorized body such as the change control board, only these changes are implemented. Regardless of the pressure from stakeholders to maintain the current schedule and the fact the formal change control process is lengthy, the project manager should ensure changes are handled properly according to the organization's change control process via a change request. Hence, of the choices offered, submitting a change request is what the project manager should do next and is, therefore, the best answer to the question asked.<br/>There is not enough information in the question to determine if the project manager has the authority to approve and make this purchase.<br/>Problems and obstacles on projects are normal. The project manager is already doing the right thing by continuously monitoring project work at regular intervals. In this instance, a variance based on measurement has occurred, and a corrective action to replace the transmitter has been recommended. Therefore, of the choices provided, submitting a change request to replace the transmitter is what the project manager should do next.<br/>While re-doing the equipment test may be a good idea to confirm or invalidate the test results before making such seemingly an expensive purchase, it should be assumed that the tests were properly conducted and the results are valid. Additionally, the question indicates that the engineering team has already confirmed the test results, making this answer choice a redundant and unnecessary action.<br/></p></div></div></div></div><br/>

Servant leadership is the practice of leading through service to the team, by focusing on understanding and addressing the needs of team members in order to enable the highest possible team performance. The role of the agile coach as a servant leader is to facilitate the team's discovery and definition of agile. Servant leaders practice and radiate agile. Servant leaders focus on purpose, people, and process. Providing feedback on the product increment developed by the team, however, is the responsibility of the product owner, not an agile coach. Since the question is asking about what to expect the 'least' from the agile coach, providing feedback on the product increment developed by the team is the best answer to the question asked.<br/>Agile leaders work with the team to define the purpose of the project and the roles of the team members in the project so that they can engage and coalesce around the project goal. The entire team optimizes at the project level, not the person level.<br/>Once the purpose of the project is established, agile leaders encourage the team to create an environment where everyone can succeed. An agile coach would ask each team member to contribute across the project work.<br/>While following a ""perfect"" agile process is a noble goal, focusing on the product, or the final result of the project is more important. ""Working software is the primary measure of progress,"" states one of the Agile Manifesto principles. This does not mean, however, that the process should be abandoned. Agile teams hold periodic retrospectives to improve the process.<br/></p></div></div></div></div><br/>

Agile teams are mainly involved in the release, iteration, and daily planning activities. User stories to be developed in the release are planned, as the name implies, at the release level. At the next level, the iteration, the product owner, and the team create the iteration backlog and prioritize the user stories based on value to the customer, risk, and other pre-defined criteria. Once the iteration is in progress, the team meets daily to report on the tasks completed a day before, coordinate the individual activities that lead up to the completion of a task for the current day, as well as inform on any impediments to progress.<br/>First, to reduce technical risks, agile teams carry out the risk-based spike, not architectural spike. Second, the question is about planning. Spikes, whether they are architectural or risk-based, are not considered to be part of the daily planning efforts.<br/>The three main levels of planning used by agile teams are release, iteration, and daily. Reporting on tasks completed a day before and coordinating the individual activities that lead up to the completion of tasks planned for today is an example of the daily planning, which typically occurs at the daily standup meeting.<br/>First, ‘acquiring project team members’ and 'resource management plan' are terms typically associated with traditional project management.

The scenario describes a situation in which a misunderstanding regarding acceptance criteria has occurred between the team and the product owner. The project manager should first gain an understanding of the underlying reason(s) for the misunderstanding, which can be accomplished by performing a root cause analysis. Once the root cause(s) have been identified, solutions proposed, and the causes removed, the problem should not recur. The sprint retrospective provides a forum for the project team to learn and adapt their practices to improve performance. The appropriate time to resolve the issue by performing a root cause analysis would be during the upcoming sprint retrospective.<br/>Performing a root cause analysis and recording the knowledge gained in the lessons learned register is the correct approach. However, this action should be taken as part of a sprint retrospective and not as part of a sprint review meeting.<br/>The daily scrum, also known as a daily standup, is a timeboxed meeting where the project team coordinates its activities. The daily scrum is a narrowly focused meeting and should not be used to resolve issues. The misunderstanding might be identified as an impediment during the meeting, but its resolution should be addressed at a different time.<br/>This answer choice describes root cause analysis, which is a technique that can be used to identify the underlying reason for the misunderstanding. Once the root cause(s) of the misunderstanding is(are) removed, the problem should not recur.

In this scenario, the stakeholders - which are only the project team here - communication needs are not being met. There are too many communications coming from too many directions via one medium, email. The quick succession of emails is causing the team to be unable to receive and respond to the communications. The current method is not working and counterproductive. As such, the project manager and team can seek out alternatives or solutions to help them out in their time of communication need. Reviewing the lessons learned is an ideal starting point. The lessons learned may identify some worthy alternatives. Or it may identify alternatives that are not helpful or worth the effort. Or both. Or little direction at all. Nonetheless, the lessons learned repository and the information it contains could give them wisdom on how to potentially proceed. Based on those initial reviews, they can then apply solutions, research more, or continue the current method - even if less than ideal - if another solution is not deemed a greater benefit than the work and disruption it may require.<br/>

One may argue the lessons learned repository should have been consulted during project planning when the communications management plan was under development.

</div></div> </div></div></div><div class='answer'><a class='ans' onclick='showHide(703)'>Ans</a><p style='display:none;' id='ans_703'>1--The sprint burndown chart is a visual representation of the project's progress over time. For example, if the team uses hours to estimate user stories in the sprint backlog, the chart would display the actual amount of work remaining in the sprint. The idea is that the amount of remaining work will 'burn down' over the course of the sprint. Burndown charts are the preferred tool used by agile teams to display sprint progress. The situation described in the scenario could have been caused by several reasons. One possible reason is that the team has overcommitted to the number of user stories they thought they would be able to complete in the sprint. This, in turn, could have been caused by inaccurate estimates the team members provided during sprint planning. However, if the initial estimation was correct, then another reason to have the gap between completed vs. planned user stories could be unforeseen risks on the project, such as loss of a key resource, increased difficulty in completing a specific task, etc.<br/>

When the blue 'Actual' line is above the red 'Schedule' line, the project is running behind schedule. In this case, some user stories may not be completed by the end of the sprint. However, that determination will be made at the end of the sprint. For now, on Day 7 of the 10-day sprint, the best thing to do is to keep the user stories as is in the sprint backlog and try to get them completed as fast as possible. In any case, the decision as to the content of the sprint backlog is done by the product owner, not the project manager.<br/>The graph shows that the amount of time to complete the initial user stories is higher than expected. However, since the team has made a commitment to complete this set of user stories, the team member should do their best to meet the sprint goal.<br/>When the curve representing the actual work completed is riding above the planned curve, the team is behind schedule. The burndown chart shows that the team is already having difficulty keeping up with the work. Therefore, adding user stories would only exacerbate the situation.<br/>It is unclear what effect re-prioritization of the user stories will have on the team performance. Assuming the team is using agile best practices, the user stories in the sprint backlog should have already been prioritized properly. In any case, backlog prioritization is the responsibility of the product owner, not the team or project manager.<br/></p></div></div></div></div><br/>

The risk report is a project document developed progressively throughout the Project Risk Management processes, which summarizes information on individual project risks and the level of overall project risk. All of the answer choices represent project documents which may be updated as a result of the Implement Risk Responses process. However, the question is specifically asking what should be done with the information regarding the reduction in overall project risk.

Since the oil leak was an identified risk already documented in the risk register, there is no need to capture it in the issue log.

The issue log does not contain information on changes to overall project risk, making this choice an incorrect answer.<br/>The lessons learned register is a project document used to record knowledge gained during a project so that it can be used in the current project and entered into the lessons learned repository. The knowledge gained regarding the effectiveness of the risk response should be captured in the lessons learned register.

New user stories have been added during the sprints two to four. If the team did not complete any work during those sprints, the curve of the burndown chart that represents the actual work completed would have pointed upwards.

(Note, the word ""phase"" in this context is used differently from how it's used in multi-phase projects). The project life cycle provides the basic framework for managing the project. Predictive, iterative, incremental, adaptive, hybrid are examples of a project life cycle. The selection of the life cycle depends on project characteristics. There are various models that can be used to describe project characteristics. One of them is the Stacey Complexity Model. The model addresses the degree of uncertainty as it relates to the project requirements on the one hand and how to fulfill those requirements using current knowledge and technology on the other hand. The technical degree of uncertainty is mapped on the horizontal axis, and the uncertainty of requirements is on the vertical axis. According to the model, as project uncertainty increases along any of those dimensions, so too does the risk of rework and the need to use a different project management approach.<br/>

When project requirements, as well as the technology to implement these requirements, are clear, the predictive project life cycle is typically the way to go. As the degree of uncertainty increases, the likelihood of changes, risk, and rework increases as well. Such projects would benefit from either iterative, incremental, adaptive, or hybrid life cycles. When both the technical degree of uncertainty and the degree of uncertainty in project requirements is very high, a project is considered chaos (or anarchy). Managing such a project is very hard to impossible.<br/>

In the scenario, the project requirements are unstable, meaning the degree of requirements uncertainty is high. However, the team feels very confident with the technology to implement the requirements, suggesting the technical degree of uncertainty is low to medium. Based on these findings, the team selects an adaptive project life cycle, implying the project has been mapped within area C.<br/>Area A represents a low degree of both technical uncertainty and requirements uncertainty. Projects that are mapped within this area are referred to as simple projects and would benefit from a predictive life cycle. In the scenario, the team selects an adaptive life cycle, making this choice an incorrect answer.<br/>Area B represents a low-to-medium degree of both technical uncertainty and requirements uncertainty. Projects that are mapped within this area are referred to as complicated projects and would benefit from one of the adaptive life cycles. While in the scenario, the team selects an adaptive life cycle, the degree of uncertainty in the project requirement is very high, implying the project is likely mapped outside of area B.<br/>Area C represents projects with one uncertainty aspect being high and the other uncertainty aspect being low-to-medium. Projects that are mapped within this area are referred to as complex projects and would benefit from an adaptive life cycle. In the scenario, the degree of uncertainty in the project requirement is very high, but the team is familiar with the technology, implying the technical degree of uncertainty is low. Also, the team selected an adaptive life cycle, making this choice the best answer to the question asked.<br/></p></div></div></div></div><br/>

In this scenario, the stakeholders include the project manager, product owner, four programmers, two testers, and a UX/UI designer, which is a total of nine individuals.

A missing mandatory parameter represents an impediment, and a realized risk, that will need to be removed in order for project work to proceed. Once surfaced during the daily scrum, the scrum master (or any other servant leader/facilitator assigned to the team) should then implement the approved risk response so the impediment can be removed as quickly as possible. Theoretically, the project team member could surface the issue directly with the scrum master rather than waiting for the daily scrum. However, this option was not provided among the answer choices.<br/>

Note, there are several technical details in the scenario, such as visualizations of the safety and efficacy of a drug, missing mandatory parameters, etc. However, this information is not required to answer this question correctly.

Impediments should be surfaced during the daily scrum meeting.<br/>A sprint review is an appropriate forum for the project team to demonstrate the product increment that has been developed during the sprint.

The risk owner is the individual that executes the risk response plan.

The question states that according to the project communications plan the project status and other information should be communicated on a project dashboard for all stakeholders to view. The data on the dashboard needs to be current enough to be relevant and valuable to stakeholders. Some team members are trying to do this but are having trouble. The project manager can lead assistance to help the team with their communications. This may be in many forms. If the assistance or removal of barriers helps, then changes might be needed. But it also starts with understanding the issues, the root causes, and seeking solutions.<br/>Incomplete and inconsistent data risks incorrect interpretations of project status and health. Misleading data may cause inappropriate responses and actions.<br/> A project manager needs to manage the project communications effectively. That may mean removing obstacles or assisting by some other method. Offering help to those in need is the best course of action among the choices given.<br/>Completing project work is very important, but so is following thru with the project communications plans. Without proper communications, the project risks failures and unpleasant surprises - possibly at the point beyond repair. Helping someone is not the same as doing the work for them.<br/></p></div></div></div></div><br/>
