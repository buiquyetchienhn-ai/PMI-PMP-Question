In a functional organization, the project manager's authority over resources is little to none, the project budget is managed by the functional managers, and the project manager works on project tasks part-time. Other project characteristics in a functional organization include little to no resource availability and part-time project management administrative staff.<br/>The document you have been working on with the project initiator is the project charter. You have already secured an approved charter, as described in the scenario, making this choice an incorrect answer.<br/>The scenario implies you have been developing a project charter which then has been approved by the project sponsor. Focus groups are an example of the data gathering technique that can be used as a tool or technique during the Develop Project Charter process to bring stakeholders together to learn about the project in a conversational way. Since the project charter has already been approved, it can be assumed that the focus groups have already been facilitated.<br/>The project charter documents high-level information on the project such as key deliverables, summary milestone schedule, key stakeholder list, and project approval requirements. Therefore, sharing the approved project charter with the stakeholders will provide them with the information described in the scenario.<br/></p></div></div></div></div><br/>

</div></div> </div></div></div><div class='answer'><a class='ans' onclick='showHide(2)'>Ans</a><p style='display:none;' id='ans_2'>4--Work performance data are the raw observations and measurements identified during activities performed to carry out the project work. In the scenario, the project manager collects all of the costs, which have been authorized, incurred, invoiced, and paid. Those are best described as the work performance data. Only after these raw data have been analyzed, will it become work performance information. Therefore, what the project manager has gathered was the work performance data.
<br/>

As it pertains to the scenario described, it is a good practice for buyers to include their selected evaluation method in the procurement documents, so bidders know how they will be evaluated. Commonly used selection methods include least cost, qualifications only, quality-based/highest technical proposal score, quality and cost-based, sole source, or fixed budget. To position your company as the best fit for the project, it is essential for you to understand the requirements and selection criteria that you need to meet as a seller. Therefore, of the choices provided, looking for the selection method in the procurement documents of the utility company's bid package is the best answer to the question asked.
<br/>

Note, the complete source selection criteria is not always provided by the buyer to the seller. These criteria are often internal for the buying organization. However, some subset of the criteria can be exposed to the prospective sellers to provide them with a better understanding of what the buyer is looking for besides the technical details of the solution.<br/>Without first thoroughly reading the bid package, you would not be prepared to ask useful questions or even assessing whether your company meets the minimum requirements.<br/>Independent cost estimates are typically developed by the buying organization, while in the scenario described you are the seller.<br/>The bid package from the buyer should provide you as a seller all the requirements and selection criteria that you need to meet.<br/></p></div></div></div></div><br/>

This situation illustrates the iterative nature of project management. Ideally, you want the team to create the team charter or at least have the team's input during the charter development. However, it is not always possible. To overcome this, the iterative nature of the project management allows the Plan Resource Management process, or any other process for that matter, to be performed several times during the project life cycle.

In a traditional waterfall project, the project scope is decomposed down to the work package level to create the work breakdown structure (WBS). On agile projects, on the other hand, the product scope is captured in the product backlog, which evolves throughout the course of the project. Agile best practices recommend that teams allocate no more than one hour per week for backlog refinement. Such an approach would allow the team to maximize the time spent developing the product increment rather than creating a detailed plan. Instead of attempting to present an updated WBS every week, the product owner should just present the overall story concept to the team and then spend no more than an hour refining the stories. This approach will free up time for the team, thus improving velocity.<br/>he vendor likely understands the importance of protecting IP in general.

When choosing a communication method, it is advisable to include the stakeholders in the final decision, so their communication needs will be met. Communication models describe the process by which information is shared and has three main parts: the sender, the message, and the receiver. Considering both communication models and communication methods will lead to the most effective communication.

<br/>Communication methods describe the way information is transferred and can be grouped into the following categories: interactive communication, push communication, and pull communication. In this scenario, the stakeholders are requesting you to switch the method used to share information with them from conference calls to email, or from an interactive method to a push method. Since the communication method is changing, this choice is correct.<br/>Communication models describe the process of communication in its most basic form: the sender, the message, and the receiver. In this scenario, the process of communication is not changing as it still involves the sender, message, and receiver, but the way the information is transferred is switching from phone to email. Therefore, the communication model is not the correct choice.<br/>The project communications are all project documents and artifacts created during the project lifecycle. Sending the status reports via email instead of having a weekly call does not change all project documents and artifacts created during the project lifecycle, making this choice an incorrect answer.<br/></p></div></div></div></div><br/>

An argument can be made that any of the answer choices represent factors that may have played a role in the decision to move forward with the project. However, a Lean Six Sigma value stream exercise as it relates to a production process is specifically related to process improvements to gain greater efficiencies in capital, labor, and/or materials.

For example, an increase in fuel costs may cause consumers to seek more fuel-efficient cars. However, the question describes the implementation of process improvement rather than a response to a change in market demand.<br/>The question suggests that a project was initiated to improve the efficiency of a manufacturing process. Although competitive forces may provide the incentive to improve the efficiency of a production line, there is another answer choice that more directly addresses the situation described by the question.<br/>The question describes a situation where the company has analyzed its production process and recommended improvements, which can be made with the initiation of a project to realize greater efficiency.<br/></p></div></div></div></div><br/>

To adequately complete and close a project, it is necessary for the project manager to obtain 'confirmation' from the customer that the project deliverables have been formally accepted. 'Confirming' the acceptance of the project deliverables during the Close Project or Phase process is different from 'obtaining' formal acceptance of the deliverables during the Validate Scope process. The scenario implies the Validate Scope process has been completed. Therefore, since the project has entered its closure, the project manager is seeking to obtain confirmation that the product scope and deliverables were achieved. By obtaining final acceptance, the project manager is essentially 'confirming' the delivery and formal acceptance of deliverables by the relevant stakeholders. Sometimes, this can be viewed as ticking a checkbox in the checklist of the activities carried out during project closure. It is like asking a question, ""Have the deliverables been accepted earlier in the project as part of the Validate Scope process?"". If the answer is ""Yes"", check the box. This would eventually confirm that the deliverables have already been accepted and that the relevant stakeholders are aware of this fact and agree that the project can now be closed. This is a subtle distinction, and many PMP aspirants struggle with this concept.

This question is a good example of what you will see on your real exam – two answer choices arguably being correct answers. The main lesson to take from this question is to be ready during the real exam to face ambiguous questions with answer choices extremely close to one another and always select the answer choice you think is the best of those provided. It will not always be the ideal answer or the answer you would like to see as the correct one, but it should be better than the others. Unfortunately, on the real exam, you will never know the actual correct answer to a particular question. You will only see your final result and will be unable to contact the PMI and argue with them on the correctness of their answers. Therefore, the best advice we can provide you while you are preparing for and taking your exam is to make reasonable assumptions based on all available information in the scenario and, of the choices given, select the ‘best’ answer to the question asked or the answer you believe should be the correct one.<br/>Inspection of deliverables takes place in the Control Quality process. This process results in verified deliverables that are then used as an input into the Validate Scope process. The question states the project manager is seeking to close out the project implying the Close Project or Phase process is being carried out, which, in turn, means that inspecting the quality of the redesign deliverables would have already taken place.<br/>While this answer choice sounds like a plausible option, the formal acceptance of project deliverables should be obtained from the customer, not from the stakeholders. Additionally, the process of 'obtaining' the formal acceptance happens prior to project closure, as part of the Validate Scope process. The Close Project or Phase process described in the scenario is concerned with 'confirming' the delivery and formal acceptance not with 'obtaining' formal acceptance. Finally, the scenario states that the project has already received formal acceptance of the deliverables, thus eliminating the need to obtained formal acceptance of project deliverables again.<br/>Obtaining feedback for design improvements would have occurred prior to performing closing processes, and therefore this answer choice is not the correct answer.<br/></p></div></div></div></div><br/>

Apart from the project kick-off meeting, there are many other agile events that provide the opportunity for face-to-face communication, such as daily standups, as well as sprint planning, review, and retrospective meetings.<br/>Letting the team members introduce the project to the new developer empowers the team members. It provides the team with a leadership opportunity as well as a strong sense of ownership for the project.<br/>On agile projects, tasks are not assigned to team members by the scrum master or anyone else. Tasks are pulled from the backlog by the team members based on agreed-upon rules.<br/></p></div></div></div></div><br/>

Some projects may not require all of the possible components of the project management plan, and their inclusion would be superfluous. In these cases, the project manager should determine the needs of the project and build a project management plan with the appropriate level of detail. Creating an overly elaborate project management plan is not an effective use of project resources.<br/>Ignoring the sponsor's request is unlikely to be the best course of action for the project manager. The project manager should explain to the sponsor that the contents of the project management plan may vary from project to project and are determined according to the needs of the project.<br/>The needs of the project determine which components of the project management plan are needed.
