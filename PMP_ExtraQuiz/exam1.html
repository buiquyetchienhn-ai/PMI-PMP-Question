In a functional organization, the project manager's authority over resources is little to none, the project budget is managed by the functional managers, and the project manager works on project tasks part-time. Other project characteristics in a functional organization include little to no resource availability and part-time project management administrative staff.<br/>Even though in a weak matrix organization a project manager has low authority over resources, it is still considered an authority that the project manager can use. The scenario, however, describes no authority at all, making weak matrix an incorrect answer choice.<br/>In a functional organization, the project manager's authority over resources is little to none, the project budget is managed by the functional manager, and the project manager is working on project tasks part-time. Based on the scenario described, you are working in a functional organization.<br/>In a balanced matrix organization, the project manager's authority over resources is low to moderate, and the project budget is managed by both the functional manager and the project manager.

In the scenario, the project manager collects all of the costs, which have been authorized, incurred, invoiced, and paid. Those are best described as the work performance data. Only after these raw data have been analyzed, will it become work performance information. Therefore, what the project manager has gathered was the work performance data.<br/>Planned value is the authorized budget assigned to scheduled work. The question describes costs that are incurred rather than the budget.<br/>Earned value is the measure of work performed expressed in terms of the budget authorized for that work. The question is asking about costs and not earned value.<br/>Work performance data, once analyzed, becomes work performance information. The question indicates that the cost analysis has yet to be performed. Therefore, this choice can be eliminated as a correct response.<br/></p></div></div></div></div><br/>

Making product-related decisions without the product owner is not aligned with agile best practices. The absence of the product owner could cause issues, as team members may not adequately understand the needs of the business. The product owner is accountable for the product backlog prioritization as well as for the clarification of the backlog items for the development team. The product owner serves as the point of contact with the business and customers. Therefore, the scrum master should contact the product owner and request them to meet with the team in order to clarify any questions the team members have about the product increment. While the correct answer is not elaborative enough as to why the scrum master should contact the product owner on behalf of the team members, it implies the goal of such contact should be to ask the product owner to be more approachable. Therefore, of the choices provided, contacting the product owner on behalf of the team members represents the best answer to the question asked.<br/>While empowered agile teams can make decisions regarding their work, product decisions should be made by business representatives, such as the product owner.<br/>The scrum master should contact the product owner and inform them of the team's need for clarification. It would also be a good idea to remind the product owner that regular and consistent feedback is an integral part of agile project success.<br/>A sprint review meeting is intended to demonstrate and get feedback for the product increment developed during the sprint, rather than resolve availability issues. Even if the issue is raised at the sprint review, waiting until the sprint review would be too late and do nothing to remove the roadblock that the team members are facing now.<br/></p></div></div></div></div><br/>

An MVP (minimum viable product, or sometimes called minimal viable product) is a functioning product but contains the least development that will satisfy early adopters. An MVP might be used to gather feedback from a subset of customers that can then influence the development of the remainder of the fully-functioning product. Additionally, an MVP allows the organization to get the product to market in the shortest timeframe to gain market share and start generating revenue. Although the deployment of the tool will be managed using waterfall, the best course of action in this scenario to obtain early customer feedback is to plan for the development of an MVP, which will be released to a subset of customers.<br/>The question states that the team needs to gather customer feedback as soon as possible. Completing the entire feature set would delay the acquisition of customer feedback beyond what is necessary. Additionally, getting customer feedback after the product has been completed in its entirety would expose the project to unnecessary rework in order to incorporate the customers' feedback. <br/>A wireframe is not an actual product, not even a prototype. A wireframe is a very basic visual representation of the product that has no functionality and, therefore, cannot be used by the target audience to provide feedback sought by the agile coach in the scenario described.<br/>An MVP (minimum, or minimal, viable product) is a functioning product but contains the least development that will satisfy early adopters.

Since a hybrid approach is being employed in this scenario, a communications management plan will likely be needed, but agile aspects of the project will require little formal documented planning. However, one consideration which needs to be accounted for is the increased number of face-to-face interactions that typically result from agile practices. For example, the project manager may need to ensure facilities are available for a war room, video conferencing, the common part of the ""caves and common"", meeting rooms, etc.<br/>Agile methodologies prioritize face-to-face communication, whereas traditional project management is more focused on the exchange of documentation. Therefore, there will likely be a decreased, not increased, exchange of documentation associated with the agile aspects of the project.<br/>When the number of stakeholders that will communicate on a project is known upfront, it is theoretically possible to calculate the number of communication channels. However, neither it's likely that the exact number of stakeholders is known upfront, nor is it clear what benefit will the knowledge of the exact number of communication channels bring to the project, specifically, to its agile aspects.<br/>Agile principles favor face-to-face communication as the most efficient and effective method of conveying information. Therefore, of the available choices, securing facilities to support face-to-face interactions is the best answer to the question asked.<br/></p></div></div></div></div><br/>

Agile measures what the team delivers, not what the team predicts it will deliver. Theoretically, the scrum master could have provided management with an estimate based on the velocity of the first completed iteration. However, since there is another answer choice that could result in a better estimate, such as the one based on several iterations, that answer choice would more accurately address the question asked. In order to provide the most accurate forecast, the scrum master should use as much actual and observed data from the project as possible. This estimation, however, assumes that management allows the team to run several iterations. Since there is no sense of urgency in the scenario, the assumption that the team has time is reasonable.<br/>With no other information available, providing an estimate based on only one iteration is plausible but not the best course of action. Under the circumstances described in the scenario and with the given set of the answer choices, another answer choice better addresses the question asked. Additionally, providing an estimate based on only one iteration would likely be inaccurate since the velocity tends to vary from iteration to iteration until it stabilizes.
<br/>Unless the scenario states otherwise, agile projects do not typically use traditional project management artifacts, such as the schedule baseline.
<br/>If and when possible, the team should defer estimating until after a few iterations as this should provide a more accurate forecast. The keyword in this answer choice is ""if possible"". If there was a sense of urgency in the scenario, e.g., the management wanted the estimation urgently, deferring the estimation would unlikely be possible.

In other words, agile leaders enable their team members to act upon decisions the teams are making. Managers in an agile environment practice servant leadership by supporting and encouraging others in their endeavors so that they can perform at their highest level and continue to improve.<br/>Agile managers are servant leaders who lead through service to the team by focusing on understanding and addressing the needs and the development of team members in order to enable the highest possible team performance.<br/>Solving problems for the team is more typical of a traditional manager than an agile leader. Agile encourages its leaders to empower teams to solve problems for themselves. If the team members, after several attempts, are unable to find a solution, an agile leader may consider stepping in and help.<br/>A working agreement is a set of rules by which team members operate. For example, the team can establish the criteria for what ""done"" means to judge the completeness of a product increment; the team can decide to use the work-in-progress (WIP) limits, respect the timebox, etc. The main point here is that it is the team members, not agile leaders, who create working agreements.<br/></p></div></div></div></div><br/>

The modification of the application to be upgraded on the new mobile device could have a significant impact on multiple project constraints, including project scope, schedule, cost, quality, communications, risk, etc. Therefore, a change request should be submitted and analyzed first before any decision is made. The change request will have to go thru the organization's change control process established for the project.<br/>A cost forecast contains either a calculated EAC value or bottom-up EAC value used to inform stakeholders of how much money the project is expected to spend once all activities have finished. Although the project stakeholders should be made aware of how much money is likely to be spent by the end of the project, a better answer would have been first to make a decision of whether to allocate more funds to capture the opportunity or not. If the funds were approved, a cost forecast may then have been issued to update project stakeholders of the new EAC taken from the revised cost baseline. However, that answer choice was not provided. Therefore, creating a forecast is not what you should do next.<br/>The question describes an opportunity to modify the application to run faster and more securely. Capturing this opportunity will likely affect multiple project constraints and baselines, so a change request should first be submitted and reviewed to understand all of its impacts. If approved, additional time and money to cover this unplanned work may be added to the cost and schedule baselines. While an ideal answer would have been to first conduct a reserve analysis to see how much of a management reserve is available or needed, followed by a change request, this option is not provided, Therefore, of the choices given, submitting a change request is the best answer to the question asked.<br/>Project funding requirements are composed of the total funding requirements and periodic funding requirements for the project. A controlled document, project funding requirements are derived from the cost baseline and may include the sources of the funding. Although eventually it will be necessary for the project manager to update the project funding requirements in consideration for any funds needed to secure the opportunity, this is not the 'next' step that should be taken. A better answer would have been to update the project funding requirements only after a change request had been submitted and approved to incorporate new funds into the cost baseline for the unexpected work, however, that option was not listed.<br/></p></div></div></div></div><br/>

In a traditional waterfall project, the project scope is decomposed down to the work package level to create the work breakdown structure (WBS). On agile projects, on the other hand, the product scope is captured in the product backlog, which evolves throughout the course of the project. Agile best practices recommend that teams allocate no more than one hour per week for backlog refinement. Such an approach would allow the team to maximize the time spent developing the product increment rather than creating a detailed plan. Instead of attempting to present an updated WBS every week, the product owner should just present the overall story concept to the team and then spend no more than an hour refining the stories. This approach will free up time for the team, thus improving velocity.<br/>With an agile project, the product owner prioritizes the backlog and sets the iteration goal. However, it is the development team, not the product owner, who determines the tasks that are required to complete the iteration goal.<br/>Agile best practices suggest that teams allocate no more than one hour per week for backlog refinement to maximize the time spent developing the product increment rather than doing the planning. Increasing the frequency of the meetings from once to twice a week would only further negatively impact the team's velocity.<br/>Rather than attempting to present an updated WBS every week, the product owner should just present the overall story concept to the team and then spend no more than an hour refining the stories.

According to the scenario, the scrum master feels that one team member is less productive than the others. But this is likely just based on one's subjective perception, which may or may not be reflective of reality. With agile methodologies, it is the development team members, not the scrum master, who are the experts on the project work. The scrum master may lack in-depth knowledge of the work requirements compared to the team members themselves. For example, the identified team member might be taking on the most difficult tasks, which make it appear that their productivity is lacking. The project team members are in a much better position to determine if a team member holds back the team. The scrum master should allow the project team members the latitude to collaborate and address relatively minor issues among themselves. In some cases, such as the one described in the scenario, providing direct feedback to the individual is not the best approach.

On a side note, this does not mean to imply that there is no action that should be taken by the scrum master. The scrum master might ensure that the team has developed and documented their team agreements. The scrum master might dig deeper to see if there are any training needs that can be addressed. However, of the available answer choices, the best course of action for the scrum master is to allow the project team members to address the issue if they deem necessary.<br/>Agile teams are self-organizing and self-managing. The scrum master may provide servant leadership and guidance with agile best practices, but the team should collaborate to complete the work rather than being directed by the scrum master.<br/>A scrum master should perform the role of a servant leader. An agile leader supports the project team rather than directs its activities. It would be inconsistent with agile best practices to direct any team member to work extra hours.<br/>Calling out a perceived performance issue with a particular team member in a group setting would not be appropriate. This action will likely cause friction within the group and between the team member and the scrum master. Performance issues should be addressed in private to respect the privacy of the individuals involved. If the project was not meeting objectives, it might be appropriate to discuss team productivity but not place blame on a particular individual.<br/></p></div></div></div></div><br/>

This coordination is typically accomplished with regularly scheduled Scrum of Scrum meetings, also known as ""meta Scrum"". Meta Scrum is a technique in which a representative of each Scrum team attends a meeting with the other representative(s) to coordinate their work. Since the project described in the scenario will utilize a project schedule in the form of a Gantt chart, these regularly scheduled and, as indicated by the scenario, extended Scrum of Scrum meetings should be reflected in the schedule to account for the time the relevant team members will spend attending these meetings.<br/>First, the scenario indicates that the project is still in planning. Change requests are not required during planning. Second, switching the Gantt chart to the burndown chart makes little sense and does not address the essence of the question, which surrounds the coordination between the teams rather than tracking their progress.<br/>A Scrum of Scrum meeting, also known as ""meta Scrum"", is a meeting in which two or more Scrum teams coordinate their activities.

This process is aimed to improve competencies, team member interaction, and the overall team environment to enhance project performance. When a team composition changes, conflict is often inevitable, especially when it involves cultural aspects. A project manager has to demonstrate cultural sensitivity, display strong interpersonal skills, and lead by example. Focus groups, ground rules, meetings (e.g., team-building activities) are among the tools and techniques that may help the project manager in reconciling the cultural differences, resolving conflicts, and, eventually, improving the overall collaboration between the team members, thus resulting in better project outcomes.<br/>Focus groups are an example of individual and team assessment tools and techniques that can be used as part of the Develop Team process implied by the scenario. With this technique, information is collected in group interviews to receive insights on a particular topic. The outputs could help the project manager better understand the root causes of the conflicts in the team and find appropriate solutions.<br/>According to the scenario, role definition has already been done but did not prevent the lack of acceptance of cultural differences among the team members. The conflict is likely to have deeper underlying causes. A more personal approach is needed to address the situation.<br/>Ground rules can be added to the team charter, helping to set clear guidelines for behavior, especially between new team members and within the team overall. Ground rules, as well as codes of conduct, are often proven as an effective tool for reconciling cultural differences in teams.<br/></p></div></div></div></div><br/>

According to the scenario, the project end date is fixed, but the scope is variable, which makes scheduling and progress reporting with typical waterfall methods problematic. Additionally, the question indicates that each of the three project teams is working independently. Both of these factors introduce complications for measuring the overall project's progress.

One way of addressing the progress reporting issues associated with a project with variable scope and independent project teams is to use a feature chart. A feature chart uses the number of features rather than story points, so there is a commonality between the project teams. The individual teams might use burn charts to measure their progress, but since it's likely that each team will define their units of measure differently, the burn charts cannot be combined into a meaningful project burn chart. A feature chart can provide a visual aid for understanding the number of features that have been completed as well as the rate of feature development over time across the project teams. Therefore, a feature chart would be an ideal tool to use in the circumstances outlined in the scenario.<br/>A feature chart can provide information about the features that have been completed, the features remaining, and the total number of features. Additionally, the feature chart can provide a visualization for the rate at which features are being developed.<br/>Since each of the three teams is working independently, they will each perform their own relative sizing exercises and definitions for the units of measure. As a result, it will not be possible to compare teams or add velocity across teams. A burndown chart may be helpful to measure progress at the team level but not at the project level in this case.<br/>A burnup chart might be helpful for each of the teams to use to measure their progress but will not be useful to measure the progress of the project. Since each team will likely define their units of measure differently, you, as the project manager, will not be able to build a meaningful project level burnup chart.<br/></p></div></div></div></div><br/>

The first step in developing emotional intelligence is self-awareness, which can then lead to self-management.

Since the scenario describes a project manager who has difficulty controlling her own temper, the best advice you can give her is to develop her emotional intelligence skills.<br/>Leadership is the ability to lead a team and inspire them to do their jobs well. There is not enough information in the question to determine if the team member is not doing their job well requiring the mentee to improve her leadership skills.

It is unlikely that a project manager can be a good leader without being able to control her own emotions.<br/>In the scenario described, your mentee is having troubles controlling her temper. Emotional intelligence is the ability to identify, assess, and manage the personal emotions of oneself and other people, as well as the collective emotions of groups of people. Emotional intelligence skills can be taught and developed. You, as a mentor, can help your mentee in achieving this goal. Therefore, of the choices provided, the best advice you can give her is to develop her emotional intelligence.<br/>Conflict management may seem like a plausible answer, but it is not the best answer among the choices given. Conflict management skills will certainly be beneficial in dealing with conflict among the team members. However, the new project manager must first develop self-awareness of how her own behavior is contributing to the problem.

An SPI of 0.6 means that the project is only progressing at 60% of the rate originally planned. Therefore, the project is behind schedule, and corrective action is required. Since the project is under budget, there is funding to bring additional team members in or crash the project.<br/>The analysis given in the scenario says the CPI is 1.5; meaning the project is getting $1.50 worth of work for every $1.00 spent or the project is under budget.

You are leading an initiative that, if successful, may result in the approval to go ahead with the project. Since past projects show that the organization did not plan resources properly, necessitating some of the work to be contracted out, thus resulting in cost overruns, you want to ensure that this time the lessons are learned and proper planning is done. To understand what resources are needed for your current (potential) project, a proof of concept cycle can be undertaken. The proof of concept could involve prototyping, feasibility study, storyboarding, development of use cases or user stories, or any other activity that can demonstrate potential business value helping to get the business case approved and the project initiated. By undertaking one of the proof-of-concept activities, the project manager can determine if the skills needed to develop the product are available in the organization, thus ensuring that the project budget is estimated realistically and the risk of cost overruns is reduced.<br/>In hybrid projects, a proof-of-concept cycle can be used to explore product features and map the skills needed to develop them. Mapping the skills helps identify gaps in the organization and plan resources accordingly. These actions, in turn, allow the project manager to create a more realistic budget estimate and reduce the risk of cost overrun.<br/>Burndown charts are typically used on agile projects to report work remaining in the iteration or release backlog. A burndown chart would unlikely help with the task requested in the scenario, which is estimating a realistic project budget based on features to be delivered and the skills required to develop them.<br/>The project charter is the document providing the project manager with the authority to apply organizational resources to project activities. While having a charter is important for any project, the scenario states that the business case, which is one of the inputs to the Develop Project Charter process, is insufficiently built, preventing the development of the project charter at this point.<br/></p></div></div></div></div><br/>

The Shu-Ha-Ri model describes the progression of skills acquisition by an individual or group. The Shu level indicates, in this case, that the project team lacks proficiency with the Scrum framework, and they should follow the rules as set forth in Scrum. Once the project team has acquired sufficient expertise with the Scrum framework, they can progress beyond the Shu level and begin to customize the approach to better suit the needs of the project and project team. Therefore, of the available choices, the best approach for the project manager is to follow the scrum ceremonies as close as possible.

Note, the way the scenario is worded implies that the project at its higher level is managed using predictive/traditional methods, while the team is using (or will use) Scrum to develop the product of the project. This means the project as a whole is carried out using a hybrid project management approach.<br/>Terminating the project is an overreaction. The Shu level of the Shu-Ha-Ri model indicates that the project team has little knowledge of the Scrum framework. Providing training to the team and/or following an established method is a better approach than terminating the project.<br/>Once an individual or team has progressed to the Ha level of the Shu-Ha-Ri model, it is appropriate to begin to consciously move away from the rules and begin tailoring the approach. However, the question states that the team is still at the Shu level, meaning that they should follow the rules until their Scrum skills have progressed.<br/>Developing a new agile method would imply that the project team has reached the Ri level of the Shu-Ha-Ri model. However, the question states that the project team is still at the Shu level. Thus, the project team is not likely to possess the necessary skill set to develop a new agile approach that will better meet project needs.<br/></p></div></div></div></div><br/>

The scenario described in the question does not suggest that other conflict resolution techniques have been used or that the situation is so acute that the project manager was left with no option except to use the force/direct technique. Since it appears the project manager did have other options, she should have pursued a win-win outcome, which the collaborative/problem-solving technique often creates. Discussing the stakeholder's idea with other stakeholders is the only conflict resolution technique offering the possibility of a win-win situation, and therefore is the best answer to the question asked.<br/>Unless the situation is an emergency (which is not the case in the scenario described), the project manager should not push her viewpoint onto others from a stance of power, known as a force/direct conflict resolution technique. This approach usually ends with a win-lose situation and therefore is not the best course of action in this situation. The project manager should have responded differently.<br/>The project manager should have used a collaborative/problem-solving approach to address the conflict, such as discussing the idea with other project stakeholders and/or the team. Such a discussion would have allowed both sides to incorporate multiple viewpoints and insights from differing perspectives and hopefully lead to a win-win outcome with consensus and commitment.<br/>The project manager may well have been demonstrating the culture of the company (raising another issue, which is outside the scope of this question) but using a force/direct technique is still not the best way to resolve a conflict.<br/></p></div></div></div></div><br/>

According to the scenario, you want to determine what your company says about the use of social media tools to communicate and work with the stakeholders to meet their needs and expectations. This implies you are looking for inputs to the Manage Stakeholder Engagement process. Organizational process assets (OPAs) are one of the inputs to this process. Corporate policies and procedures for social media are an example of OPAs. It is typical for organizations to prohibit or provide guidelines on the use of social media when done on behalf of the business. You should first check the corporate policies and procedures before encouraging employees to use social media as a business tool.

Note, the scenario describes a hybrid project which involves an agile team developing the software and a traditional engineering team designing the hardware. This information, however, does not change the correct answer. Regardless of whether the project is predictive, agile, or hybrid, organizational process assets are the best place to find the corporate policies and procedures for the use of social media on projects performed by the organization.<br/>The stakeholder register is a project document that captures the identification, assessment, and classification of project stakeholders. While the stakeholder register may mention communication preferences of some of the stakeholders, this document does not include information about the company's guideline about the use of social media tools to communicate and work with the stakeholders.<br/>Organizational process assets include corporate policies and procedures for social media. You should review the company's social media policy before using social media as a business tool.<br/>The project sponsor may or may not be aware of policies for social media.

Agile release planning provides a high-level summary timeline of the release schedule. When a product is developed incrementally based on the release plan, iteration and release review meetings can be used by the team and stakeholders to inspect the completed product increments regularly. During these meetings, requirements are refined for future activities, and the release plan and key variables can be adjusted. In hybrid projects with strict budget constraints, like the project described in the scenario, these adjustments would be applied to scope and schedule, thus helping the project manager to determine the budget based on realistic plans. In other words, the information in the release plan will serve as an input to the review meetings with stakeholders, which, in turn, may help the project manager determine the project budget.<br/>The cost management plan describes how the project costs will be planned, structured, and controlled. Release plans are typically used on more agile or hybrid projects and are not part of the cost management plan.<br/>The velocity is the rate at which deliverables are produced, validated, and accepted per iteration. Increasing the velocity unreasonably can negatively affect the project team and eventually result in a drop in productivity. It's unclear how increasing velocity may help the project manager determine the project budget.<br/>Burndown charts are used to visualize the remaining effort towards a specific goal. In the case of a release burndown chart, the goal is the completion of a release. A trend line in a burndown chart projects a likely completion date for the effort remaining, based on current progress. The trendline shows the time by which remaining work is estimated to be done, rather than information related to costs.<br/></p></div></div></div></div><br/>

The features are first prioritized and then developed accordingly. When prioritizing a backlog, risks and value are typically the primary considerations (aside from legal or other requirements). The backlog must be prioritized and reprioritized throughout the project to determine what to include in each iteration. High-value features should be prioritized first as not all features are likely to be developed due to project constraints. Agile projects generate revenue by releasing product increments to the market with the high-value features first while lower priority features are still being developed.

Risks must also be considered when prioritizing the product backlog. High-risk features should be prioritized over lower risk ones. When there is a risk of failure, as in this case, it is better to fail earlier in the project rather than later when more project resources have been expended. Additionally, the development of high-risk features is more likely to cause rework. Developing high-risk features earlier may reduce the amount of rework required.

It is important to remember that a feature’s risk and value profile may change during the project life cycle and will require monitoring for possible reprioritization.

Therefore, of the available choices, the high-value and high-risk features should be prioritized and developed first in this scenario.<br/>High-value and low-risk features should be prioritized after the high-value and high-risk features. Although these features might provide as much value as the high-value and high-risk features, they have less risk. High-risk features carry an inherent risk of failure for the project and it is more cost effective to fail early rather than later in the project.<br/>Low-value features are prioritized after all high-value features. With agile projects, it is likely that some features will not be developed given the project constraints. It is best to give these features a lower priority because of the greater likelihood that they will generate less revenue and, therefore, would not be included in the final product.<br/>High-value and high-risk features should be developed first. These features deliver the most value to the project. Additionally, the high-risk features should be prioritized over low-risk features because, among other reasons, high-risk features are far more likely to cause the project to fail. If a project is going to fail, it is better to fail earlier in the project when fewer resources have been expended.<br/></p></div></div></div></div><br/>

Processes of the Monitoring and Controlling Process Group are carried out throughout the project. According to the project generic life cycle, the cost of changes are about equal to project risks in the middle or late middle of the project. In the scenario, the project team is currently implementing an approved change request. This activity is undertaken in the Direct and Manage Project Work process, part of the Executing Process Group. Since execution takes place approximately halfway into the project timeline where the curve representing the cost of changes intersects with the curve representing the risk, it would be true to say that the cost of changes is nearly equal with project risk.

If you are still not convinced, consider this: the lowest/highest values as far as the cost of changes and risk are concerned, apply to the very beginning or end of the project. One moment after the project has been initiated, the cost of changes is one tick higher than its lowest level, and the risk is one tick lower than its highest level. The same applies to project closure: one moment before the project is closed, the cost of changes is one tick lower than its highest level, and the risk is one tick higher than its lowest level.<br/> Zero cost of changes and zero project risk can typically be encountered before the processes of the Initiating Process Group take place. According to the scenario described, the project team is implementing a change request, implying the project is in execution. Therefore, this answer choice can be eliminated.<br/>The cost of changes is lowest, and uncertainties highest, during the Planning Process Group, before any work has begun. In the scenario, work has already begun, making this choice an incorrect answer.<br/>Since the cost of changes rises throughout the project, and risk decreases throughout the project, their trend lines cross and are equal in the middle or late part of project execution. According to the scenario, the project team is implementing an approved change request. Since this activity takes place during the Direct and Manage Project Work process that belongs to the Executing Process Group, this choice represents a true statement and is, therefore, the best answer.<br/></p></div></div></div></div><br/>

The team members need to know what they are doing well and what could they improve. One-on-one meetings set at scheduled intervals are one of the agile coaching practices. However, issues that require immediate attention (the iteration goal is in jeopardy risking the whole project) should be addressed by agile leaders in real-time. As part of the on-going coaching efforts, the agile coach has to step in, understand why the performance of the developer has degraded, and help the developer to resolve the issue. This help should be provided without waiting for the pre-scheduled one-on-one meeting, which could be too late in this situation.

As stated by the authors in the reference, ""And even these scheduled one-on-ones are not meant to prevent the team’s coach from helping the team when he or she sees a clear need. Don't wait for a one-on-one if you see an action occurs that needs redirection. Employ real-time feedback and address the issues as they arise; try to provide the feedback as close to the event as possible so it is more meaningful and corrections can be made quickly.""<br/>Self-organizing teams may challenge internal management policies, and managers may struggle with the individual performance appraisals. On agile projects, individual team members are typically not appraised. Agile promotes a team rather than an individual performance assessment.<br/>Swarming on the tasks assigned to the developer might be a plausible option. However, with only two days left to the end of the iteration, it is reasonable to assume that by completing the tasks of the developer, the team members will be unable to complete their own tasks. Therefore, in this situation, swarming is unlikely to be the best course of action.<br/>With only two days left until the end of the iteration and the whole project, the agile coach should do everything in their power to help the team member resolve the issue and accomplish the iteration goal.

Earned value management is typically used when a predictive project management approach is employed. However, earned value measurements can easily be applied to agile metrics, as well. This information might be particularly useful with a hybrid project. The schedule performance index (SPI) can be calculated using story points by dividing the story points completed during an iteration by the story points planned. In this case, the team completed 45 story points for the first iteration with a plan of 50; thus, 45 / 50 provides us with an SPI of 0.9.<br/>It's true that the team failed to complete the iteration goal, as only 45 story points of the 50 planned were completed. It is also true that agile best practices do not support the inclusion of partially completed user stories in velocity measurements. However, the 45 story points completed represent the point value of the features that were completed. Therefore, the velocity would be 45, not zero, in this case.<br/>Velocity can be represented by the number of story points completed per iteration. In this scenario, the team completed 45 points in the first iteration; thus, the velocity would be 45, not 50.<br/>The schedule performance index can be calculated as the number of story points completed divided by the story points planned.

'Quality' and 'grade' are not the same concepts and are often confused. Quality refers to ""the degree to which a set of inherent characteristics fulfill requirements"" (ISO 9000 [18]). Grade as a design intent is a category assigned to deliverables having the same functional use but different technical characteristics. In this scenario, the quantity of features (grade) is acceptable while the quality of the deliverables is poor, which may be represented by the number and/or severity of defects. Therefore, of the available options, introducing more rigorous testing during the next sprint to reduce bugs is the best course of action in this scenario. Note, the scenario indicates that the project is lead by agile methods, where frequent quality and review steps are already supposed to be built in throughout the project rather than the end of the project. However, it seems that the current quality assurance activities have been insufficient. Hence, introducing more rigorous testing from the next sprint onwards will likely help to address the issue.

<br/>There is no information presented by the question to suggest that the project is running behind schedule. The question indicates that there is an issue with the quality of the product. Increasing velocity without taking any other action is not likely to improve the quality of the deliverables.<br/>While quality is an issue in this scenario, removing some of the features may not be acceptable to the customer. Having a robust set of features is an example of a higher-grade product. Reducing the number of features may make the grade unacceptable regardless of what happens with quality.<br/>The quantity of features is an example of the product grade.

You should choose the most appropriate conflict resolution method based on factors such as the importance and the intensity of the conflict and timelines. According to the scenario, the subject of the conflict (a report format) is not critical to project success. The project, however, has a critical time constraint and cannot afford any delays. Therefore, you need to address the dispute quickly so that the team members can return to work without further delay. The quickest way to resolve the conflict in this situation, and, therefore, your best course of action, is to use the force/direct method by selecting an approach that you think is the best and make the decision. Note, the collaborative or problem-solving approach, which incorporates multiple viewpoints and insights from different perspectives, is ideal to resolve conflicts. However, such an approach is not always possible. Project managers should use their interpersonal and team skills and situational judgment to determine how best to handle a conflict.<br/>Telling the team members to figure it out for themselves is an example of the withdraw/avoid technique where you retreat from the situation allowing it to be fixed later or by others. This method would take time that you cannot afford. Therefore, this approach is not the best way to resolve the conflict.<br/>Looking for a resolution to the conflict that would completely satisfy both parties is an example of the collaborate/ problem-solving technique, which leads to a win-win solution. Under the circumstances provided in the scenario, in which the argument turns into a shouting match, reaching a win-win solution is unlikely realistic given the short timeline and the intensity of the conflict.<br/>Since the project has a critical time constraint and cannot afford any delays, requesting the team members to go back to work may be a plausible option. However, this approach may harm the project manager's reputation and is not consistent with the best practices of being a servant leader for the project team.<br/></p></div></div></div></div><br/>

The scenario implies that you are involved in the Monitor Communications process. The Monitor Communications process can trigger an iteration of the Plan Communications Management process, as is demonstrated in this scenario, to improve the effectiveness of communication through amended communications plans. The key benefit of the Plan Communication Management process is to document an effective approach to engage stakeholders by presenting them with information relevant to them. In this scenario, however, the communications are not engaging the marketing stakeholders, and therefore the communications need to be analyzed and adjusted accordingly. Therefore, performing a communication styles assessment next could identify ways to tailor future communications and enhance the marketing stakeholders' engagement.<br/>A communication styles assessment is used to determine communication styles and identify the preferred communication method, format, and content for planned project communications. After learning gaps in the marketing stakeholders' engagement may be related to communication, this assessment can be useful for planning tailored activities or artifacts to be used in future interactions.<br/>Providing technical training for the marketing department is a plausible option, even though it's unclear if the project budget and schedule permit this. However, the essence of the question surrounds ineffective communications rather than the lack of technical knowledge of particular stakeholders. Therefore, instead of focusing on training and spending project resources, it's better to improve project communications.<br/>In the scenario, you have learned the project communications are too technical for the marketing department; however, you have not yet determined how to change the communications to suit these stakeholders better.

Projects with adaptive life cycles are intended to respond to high levels of change and require close and consistent stakeholder engagement. Often the full scope of the project is not understood at the beginning of the project, or it evolves during the project. Therefore, the deliverables are developed over multiple iterations where a detailed scope is defined and approved at the beginning of each iteration. In an adaptive life cycle, a high-level vision for the project is decomposed into an ordered list of requirements and work which is contained in the backlog list. At the beginning of each iteration, the team determines how many of the items on the backlog list can be delivered with the iteration. This action corresponds to the Collect Requirements process. The chosen requirements from the backlog list are then used to define a detailed scope for that iteration. Lastly, the scope for the iteration is decomposed into the work required for that iteration's approved scope, meaning the Create WBS process is performed. Therefore, the processes of Collect Requirements, Define Scope, and Create WBS are performed for each iteration of the project.<br/>Before beginning the iteration, the team determines which items on the backlog will be delivered or, in other words, which requirements will be addressed in the iteration. The requirements will be used to define a detailed scope for the iteration. Therefore, the iteration requires more than the Define Scope process.<br/>In an adaptive life cycle, the deliverables are developed over multiple iterations where a detailed scope is defined and approved for each iteration when it begins. While Collect Requirements and Create WBS are performed with each iteration, so is Define Scope. Therefore, this is not the best answer to the question asked.<br/>In an adaptive life cycle, the requirements constitute the backlog, and the team will determine how many of the requirements will be delivered in the next iteration. After the requirements are determined for the iteration, a detailed scope will be defined. However, the iteration also needs to be broken down into manageable parts for execution, which is accomplished through the Create WBS process.

Using basic math operations, the later start can be calculated as:

Option 2. Alternatively, we could use the relevant formula from the backward pass of the critical path method.

At a high level, agile teams tend to be a lot more focused on continuous improvement and will review performance more regularly. Agile projects conduct retrospectives at the end of each iteration (typically two weeks to one month), which provides a more structured and proactive approach to continuous improvement. A retrospective is an example of a meeting, tool or technique used during the Control Quality process to drive continuous improvement. Additionally, agile team retrospectives can focus on the team’s working practices – how they work together, celebrating a job well done, bettering the relationships in the team, and often a more traditional approach focuses on the project tasks and deliverables and not how the team performed together.<br/>Waterfall project management approaches typically review project lessons learned towards the end of the project. Any lessons learned during project execution are captured on a reactive basis as they occur. The agile framework takes a more proactive approach by conducting retrospectives at the end of each iteration (typically two weeks to one month) and the end of the project.<br/>Agile projects conduct both iteration and project retrospectives. Project retrospectives are conducted at the end of the project and review performance and lessons learned for the whole project. In projects managed using waterfall methodologies, retrospective (lessons learned) meetings are typically held only at the end of the project.<br/>Agile projects conduct retrospectives at the end of each iteration (typically two weeks or one month) and the end of the project. This methodology provides a more structured approach to continuous improvement where continuous improvement is an integral part of project execution.<br/></p></div></div></div></div><br/>

Tailoring considerations for the quality management processes include standards and regulatory compliance, among others. The question states that an internal audit uncovered a discrepancy with International Organization for Standardization (ISO) 9000 standards. ISO 9000 represents a set of industry standards, which are widely followed by organizations. Many organizations have policies requiring adherence to ISO quality standards as an ISO certified organization. The tailoring consideration of standards and regulatory compliance includes industry standards of which ISO 9000 is an example. The fact that the discrepancy was uncovered during an internal audit implies that the performing organization complies with ISO 9000 standards, otherwise there would be no reason to include this review in an audit. Therefore, of the available choices, the project manager most likely neglected the tailoring consideration of standards and regulatory compliance earlier in the project.

A project team that uses a traditional waterfall approach does not typically require short feedback loops compared to an agile team since the predictive approach has team tasks planned in advance. According to the scenario, the predictive team needs to be kept apprised of the Scrum team's activities due to dependencies between the teams' deliverables. One of the ceremonies associated with Scrum is the daily standup meeting (also known as the daily Scrum). During a daily standup meeting, each project team member describes what they accomplished since the previous daily Scrum (typically, from yesterday), what they plan to accomplish today, and informs if there are any impediments to progress. Having the predictive team members attend the daily Scrum will allow them to be apprised of the Scrum teams activities and help with the coordination of dependent activities.

One of the tools and techniques associated with the Develop Team process is training. Training the new developer in the lacking programming language will enhance the productivity of the project team. According to the scenario, the project CPI is 0.75 implying the project is over budget, therefore, absorbing the required training costs is problematic for the project. However, there is another alternative which will not affect the project budget. Training costs may be supported by the performing organization if the added skills will be useful for future projects which is the case in the situation presented. Therefore, the best course of action is to seek approval for the performing organization to absorb the training costs as it will help the current project and may benefit future projects.<br/>The development approach is a component of the project management plan that describes a development approach selected for the project, such as predictive, iterative, agile, or a hybrid model. The development approach is unlikely to change as a result of a developer being unable to code in a specific programming language.<br/>The project manager should seek alternatives in addressing the gap in skillset, which will not affect the project budget. In this case, training costs may be supported by the performing organization if the added skills will be useful for future projects.<br/>If the programming language were becoming obsolete or does not fit in with the organization's technical strategy, then this choice might make sense. However, the question does not support such obsolescence or trend. It states that future projects are also expected to utilize this language. Just because a new developer lacks competence in a programming language, does not mean that the project should cease to use it.<br/></p></div></div></div></div><br/>

It may be a prior version of the product they are working on, or it may be an unrelated system. When a team makes a commitment to complete a set of stories during an iteration, they need to do so with their maintenance and support load in mind."" In the scenario provided, it seems as the team knew that they were responsible for supporting products that were not associated with completing the work on the current project. However, the team most likely missed to account for this work during the iteration/release planning. Therefore, the failure to complete and deliver the planned work lies with the team. However, this does not mean the scrum master should remove support work from the next iteration onward. While the situation is not ideal, the scrum master should explain that routine work of supporting prior releases may be included in project plans and try to come to a reasonable solution with the stakeholders, solution that would allow the team to complete the current project and, at the same time, support the prior releases, without too much overtime work.

One approach to account for work not directly related to the current project is first to allocate a percentage or an average amount of time typically required to accomplish these routine tasks. Once this is done, the time left in the iteration can be used to estimate the number of user stories (or story points, features, etc.) of the current project that can be reasonably completed in the time remaining. Another alternative would be to place a user story of a size equivalent to the estimated size of the support work in the iteration backlog.<br/>Even though the support duties seem to be negatively impacting the current project, removing all further support work from the next iterations without consulting with the stakeholders that were involved in the prior projects/releases and were likely those who requested the support, would be an overreaction. While removing the support work would likely help the current project, it would harm the customers who use the prior releases, which, in turn, may have a negative impact on the performing organization.<br/>With some rare exceptions, statements that suggest ignoring stakeholders typically constitute incorrect answers.<br/>Routine work of supporting prior releases may be included as part of the current project/release/iteration. However, this routine work should be planned ahead and discussed at release and iteration planning meetings. Relevant stakeholders from the current and previous projects should be invited to ensure the plans are agreed upon by all parties involved.<br/></p></div></div></div></div><br/>

An agile framework is typically used when the project scope is not well understood at the start of the project (which is the case in the scenario described) and is progressively elaborated throughout project execution. This situation creates special considerations when contracting with a vendor to supply developers. One method of addressing the issue is to use contract terms that include fixed-price increments. With this approach, the scope is decomposed into microdeliverables, such as user stories, and the vendor will be paid a fixed price for each of these microdeliverables.

In this scenario, the development team will complete the user stories determined during sprint planning. At the end of the sprint, during the sprint review, the development team will demonstrate the product increment that was developed during the sprint to the product owner and other relevant stakeholders. The product owner then has the authority and responsibility for approving or rejecting the deliverables.<br/>With a contract featuring fixed-price increments, the project scope (or the scope specified in the SOW in the scenario described) can be decomposed into fixed-price microdeliverables, such as user stories. With this type of contract, there is no reason nor is this appropriate per agile best practices to wait until the entire project scope has been completed before approving the deliverables.<br/>During a sprint review, the development team demonstrates the product increment that was developed during the sprint. The product owner then has the responsibility for approving or rejecting the deliverables.<br/>The use of sprints creates a cadence of predictable, timeboxed pre-agreed, consistent duration that aids with scheduling. Validating the user stories as soon as they are completed at any point in a sprint before the timebox is over, would interfere with the team's work, break the cadence, and negatively affect the project schedule, and may have other unintended consequences.<br/></p></div></div></div></div><br/>

This process is sometimes called quality assurance. Manage Quality is the process of translating the quality management plans into executable quality activities. These activities can ideally be performed by anyone on the team with the proper training, guidance, and tools. In this scenario, the tools and methods used by the quality assurance lead for the quality activities have been working well. Any data captured from the activities can be used and analyzed to report the status of the project quality and control the quality, as needed. It is important for the project to continue these activities as part of the Manage Quality process throughout the project. Unfortunately, the project can not use its current subject matter expert (SME) but should seek alternatives, such as reassigning another resource to the task(s).

Therefore, of the available options, assigning another team member to carry out the originally planned quality activities is the best answer to the question asked.

<br/>While it is reasonable to assume that some of the project work will be impacted by the departure of the QA lead, there is not enough information in the question to determine if the cost or schedule baseline will need to be modified.

Meetings are an example of the tools and techniques that can be used as part of both processes. A meeting between the project manager and the new key stakeholder can take the form of an interview allowing both parties to get to know each other and set expectations for the project. The questions asked during the interview should be designed in a way that would help the project manager identify the inputs of the Plan Stakeholder Engagement process as it relates to this particular stakeholder. For example, stakeholder's risk appetites, stakeholder's communication preferences, lessons that the stakeholder has learned from past projects, level of stakeholder's support for the project are among the inputs that can be used by the project manager in the process of updating the stakeholder engagement plan.<br/>The new stakeholder joins the project to replace another stakeholder, not the project manager. Therefore, while the project management experience may come in handy, it is not required for and is unlikely to be a factor in updating the stakeholder engagement plan as requested by the scenario.<br/>Stakeholder risk appetites are among the enterprise environmental factors (EEFs) that can be used as an input to the Plan Stakeholder Engagement process implied by the scenario. Risk appetite is an important input because it can have a direct impact on the risk management strategies applied throughout the course of the project.<br/>It is unlikely that the answer to this question will have a significant (if any) impact on the stakeholder engagement process implied by the scenario or would require an update to the stakeholder engagement plan.

</div></div> </div></div></div><div class='answer'><a class='ans' onclick='showHide(61)'>Ans</a><p style='display:none;' id='ans_61'>3--Aggressive transparency is a term often used on agile projects that refers to sharing project information within and across the performing organization. Promoting aggressive transparency is beneficial on projects that experience a high degree of change where active engagement and participation with project stakeholders is essential. Such an approach may help facilitate timely, productive discussion and decision making, allowing the project teams to engage with stakeholders directly rather than going through layers of management. Often the client, user, and developer exchange information in a dynamic co-creative process that leads to more stakeholder involvement and higher satisfaction. Regular interactions with the stakeholder community throughout the project mitigate risk, build trust, and support adjustments earlier in the project life cycle, thus reducing costs and increasing the likelihood of project success.<br/>Project reporting is one of the tools and techniques of the Manage Communications process. This approach of sharing project information is typical for traditionally lead projects. The scenario, however, describes an agile project.<br/>Daily standups are timeboxed, typically 15-minute meetings, where the project team members report on work done since yesterday, work to be done today, and any impediments to progress. While inviting stakeholders to a daily standup may contribute to sharing some project details, this information is very limited and technical and unlikely to meet the needs of sharing project information within and across the organization as requested by the scenario. Another answer choice better addresses the question asked.<br/>In order to accelerate the sharing of information within and across the organization, agile methods promote aggressive transparency. Inviting stakeholders to project meetings and reviews or posting project artifacts in public spaces would help surface any misalignments, dependencies, or other issues related to the frequently changing project.<br/></p></div></div></div></div><br/>

This situation implies that the project, as a whole, will adopt a hybrid project management framework. With the product development phase following an incremental model, the product increments can be released as they are completed. In this situation, a product demonstration should be conducted once the product increment has been developed. Having the dealers attend the product demonstrations virtually will allow the dealers to view the product increment and provide their feedback while minimizing the impact on the dealer's regular responsibilities.<br/>An iteration retrospective is a meeting aimed to learn about, improve, and adapt the process the team uses to develop the product/service of the project. Those meetings are not used to obtain feedback for the product.<br/>Collecting comprehensive requirements upfront and developing a detailed WBS for the product should be done when using a predictive project management framework. However, the scenario stipulates that the product will be developed using an incremental project lifecycle. Therefore, requirements and scope will be progressively elaborated rather than planned in advance.<br/>Since the team is virtual and the dealers are dispersed nationwide, virtual tools will be needed for collaboration.

This suggests the team members are generalizing specialists and experts in their domains. Agile teams are self-organizing and self-managing. Iterative and agile project management approaches promote the engagement of team members as local domain experts in integration management. The team members determine how plans and components should integrate. In adaptive environments, control of the detailed product planning and delivery is delegated to the team. The project manager's focus is on building a collaborative decision-making environment and ensuring the team has the ability to respond to changes.

One may argue that the team member has the figures of the work in progress, allowing the implementation of the earned value analysis (EVA), and, hence, making the EVA a better answer choice. This is not the case, since, according to the scenario, the team member has only a 'rough' assessment of the vendor's current work in progress, and she 'suspects' that the vendor will be unable to complete the work on time.

One of the principles outlined in the Agile Manifesto states, ""Simplicity - the art of maximizing the amount of work not done - is essential."" Compliance activities represent overhead, which does not directly provide value. In keeping with an agile mindset, the project manager should minimize the overhead and only include those compliance activities that are necessary. Classifying the compliance categories is one of the tasks associated with the Business Environment domain of the Project Management Professional (PMP)® Examination Content Outline. Classifying the compliance categories that have been captured in the organization's policies and procedures may be helpful in differentiating those that require the expenditure of resources and those that do not. For example, the organization may have specific guidelines for complying with union rules and activities. However, if the project underway will not have union involvement, then that entire compliance category can be disregarded.<br/>The selection of a project management framework should be based upon the needs of the project rather than simply compliance activities. Compliance can be effectively addressed by any project management framework<br/>According to the scenario, only some of the organization's policies and procedures regarding compliance will be applicable to the project. There is no reason to develop strategies for the policies and procedures that do not apply to the project.

Regardless of the project management frameworks, the two teams will need to coordinate their efforts to build the final product closely. The ideal approach would be to colocate both teams in the same physical location, but the scenario stipulates that this is not an option. Therefore, the project manager can recreate physical colocation in a virtual environment with the use of a fishbowl window.

To reduce the business impact on the organization and decrease the potential stress such a change may cause, the transition should be implemented gradually. This can be achieved by incorporating practices that have proven to be successful. Examples include involving business analysts in requirements management, implementing tools to identify complex project elements, incorporating agile, incremental, and iterative practices, etc. Increasing the level of detail during initial project planning, however, is typical of a traditional project management approach where most of the project planning is done upfront with as many details as possible. Since the organization wants to move away from the traditional project management approach toward a hybrid one, increasing the level of detail during initial project planning would be the least likely option for you to recommend to the organization.<br/>The scenario is talking about an uncertain market environment and complex projects, implying unclear and likely evolving requirements. One of the business analyst's responsibilities is to prioritize requirements based on customer needs so that the project delivers the highest value possible as soon as possible. This approach is typically used on agile projects. Therefore, incorporating agile practices into traditional projects would contribute to transitioning from traditional to hybrid methods.<br/>This choice describes one of the practices used in a traditional project management approach where requirements are stable, allowing for the project to be planned upfront and in great detail. Since the question is asking about the 'least' likely approach of transitioning to hybrid methods, this choice represents the best answer.<br/>Increased project complexity, as described by the scenario, typically leads to an increased risk of rework. Implementing tools to identify complex project elements may help reduce such risks. To minimize the risks and manage complex projects more efficiently, companies striving to transition to hybrid methodologies may take advantage of these tools.<br/></p></div></div></div></div><br/>

(Note, the word ""phase"" in this context is used differently from how it's used in multi-phase projects). The project life cycle provides the basic framework for managing the project. Predictive, iterative, incremental, adaptive, hybrid are examples of a project life cycle. The selection of the life cycle depends on project characteristics. There are various models that can be used to describe project characteristics. One of them is the Stacey Complexity Model. The model addresses the degree of uncertainty as it relates to the project requirements on the one hand and how to fulfill those requirements using current knowledge and technology on the other hand. The technical degree of uncertainty is mapped on the horizontal axis, and the uncertainty of requirements is on the vertical axis. According to the model, as project uncertainty increases along any of those dimensions, so too does the risk of rework and the need to use a different project management approach.

When project requirements, as well as the technology to implement these requirements, are clear, the predictive project life cycle is typically the way to go. As the degree of uncertainty increases, the likelihood of changes, risk, and rework increases as well. Such projects would benefit from either iterative, incremental, adaptive, or hybrid life cycles. When both the technical degree of uncertainty and the degree of uncertainty in project requirements is very high, a project is considered chaos (or anarchy). Managing such a project is very hard to impossible.

In the scenario, the project team selects a predictive life cycle, implying the project has been mapped within area A, which represents the low degree of both technical uncertainty and requirements uncertainty.<br/>Area A represents a low degree of both technical uncertainty and requirements uncertainty. Projects that are mapped within this area are referred to as simple projects and would benefit from a predictive life cycle. In the scenario, the team selects the predictive life cycle, making this choice the best answer to the question asked.<br/>Area B represents a low-to-medium degree of both technical uncertainty and requirements uncertainty. Projects that are mapped within this area are referred to as complicated projects and would benefit from one of the adaptive life cycles. In the scenario, the team selects the predictive life cycle, making this choice an incorrect answer.<br/>Area C represents projects with one uncertainty aspect being high and the other uncertainty aspect being low-to-medium. Projects that are mapped within this area are referred to as complex projects and would benefit from an adaptive life cycle. In the scenario, the team selects the predictive life cycle, making this choice an incorrect answer.<br/></p></div></div></div></div><br/>

A key action when closing a phase is transferring the ownership of your phase's intermediary deliverables to the proper group or organization tasked with using the output from your phase to meet the project objectives in their phase. You would consult the project management plan, specifically the subsidiary project life cycle description because it describes the series of phases that a project passes through from its initiation to its closure. While the PMBOK® Guide does not explicitly state that the project management plan specifies ‘who’ in the next phase takes ownership of the deliverables from the previous phase, it is reasonable to assume that, of the choices given, only the project management plan is likely to have this information and is, therefore, the best answer to the question asked.<br/>The project management plan defines the basis of all project work and how the work will be performed. Transferring the ownership of deliverables to the assigned stakeholders is done in accordance with the project management plan to facilitate project closures. The project management plan would indicate who will manage the next phase (and subsequent phases) in the development of the new ergonomic pen and would also identify the recipient of the final product.<br/>The final report provides a summary of the project performance, such as a summary level description of the project or phase, and objectives for scope, quality, cost, and schedule as well as validation information for the output, a summary of risks/issues, and how the deliverable achieved business objectives. The final report does not include information on who will take ownership of the project or phase output.<br/>The project scope statement is created during project planning and includes the description of the project scope, major deliverables, and exclusions. The project scope does not indicate what group or organization the final pen design will transfer to at the completion of a project phase.<br/></p></div></div></div></div><br/>

</div></div> </div></div></div><div class='answer'><a class='ans' onclick='showHide(75)'>Ans</a><p style='display:none;' id='ans_75'>4--Agile methodologies are typically used when requirements are not well-understood upfront. Thus, agile contracts need to focus on collaborative efforts and aligning the contract terms with the project goals. Unlike an adversarial approach of winners versus losers, which will likely result in an increased risk to the project, a collaborative approach is one that pursues a shared-risk-reward relationship, where all sides win. Therefore, pursuing a shared-risk-reward relationship for the outsourced portion of the work in which requirements are not well-defined upfront is the best course of action in this situation.

Note, the scenario describes a project in which most of the project scope is managed using the traditional/predictive project management approach (WBS) while the outsourced portion of work is carried out using the agile framework. This means the project as a whole is managed in a hybrid way. While this information does not change the correct answer, it is important to understand that projects can be managed using various approaches, including predictive (sometimes called traditional or waterfall), agile (Scrum, Kanban, etc.), or hybrid which is a combination of both.<br/>The Agile Manifesto supports the idea of customer collaboration over contract negotiation. This does not mean, however, that formal contracts are not used for agile projects (or for the outsourced deliverables that managed using agile methods). The contract type and terms may differ with an agile project versus waterfall, but vendor agreements should still be captured in a formal contract.<br/>A fixed-price contract would be better suited to a waterfall project as opposed to agile. With waterfall projects, the scope is generally well-understood upfront. With agile projects, the project scope is more likely to be progressively elaborated. As a result, it would be challenging to determine contract terms for the entire outsourced scope upfront.<br/>While it may seem natural to seek the most advantageous contract terms, this approach may not produce the best results for any project. With agile projects, the project scope is not typically well understand initially, which means that greater cooperation will be necessary. Thus, it will be preferable to seek contract terms that put vendor performance in alignment with the project goals, rather than driving the hardest bargain.<br/></p></div></div></div></div><br/>

</div></div> </div></div></div><div class='answer'><a class='ans' onclick='showHide(76)'>Ans</a><p style='display:none;' id='ans_76'>3--The scenario describes a project with elements of both predictive and agile project management approaches. This means the project, as a whole, is lead using hybrid methods. The project manager wants to introduce a process change towards more direct interaction with stakeholders; thus, making the project even more hybrid. When changing processes, it is essential to clarify new roles and responsibilities and update the project artifacts accordingly. It also helps to show how changes to the cost baseline could have been measured in past projects if they used variance analysis iteratively as opposed to the traditional earned value analysis. Connecting with other agile or hybrid practitioners in the organization is another constructive way to exchange knowledge and support the transformation. However, leaving change requests affecting the cost baseline out of the discussion could negate the whole idea of changing the process. Therefore, of the choices provided, excluding those requests from the discussion would 'least' likely to convince the stakeholders of the benefits of the new process, making this choice the best answer to the question asked.

Note, according to agile best practices, daily standup meetings are not used to discuss changes. They are intended to answer three questions, such as, ""What did I do since the last standup?"", ""What is my plan for today?"", and, ""Are there any impediments to my progress?"" However, first, the question is describing a hybrid project where agile and traditional practices converge, and, second, the parking lot of a daily standup meeting is the time allocated to discuss impediments and other issues after the three main questions have been addressed.<br/>The cost management plan describes how the project costs will be planned, structured, and controlled. The change management plan describes how the changes to the project will be managed. When a process that involves changes to project costs is also changing, both plans should be updated. This may help get buy-in for the new process from those stakeholders who are accustomed to the traditional project management approach.<br/>When a hybrid project management approach is used, like the one suggested by the scenario, trend and variance analysis data is accumulated and assessed every iteration. This iterative assessment enables project managers to monitor and respond to budget variations in a timely manner. Demonstrating how a predictive project could have benefited from the iterative analysis can be a powerful way to show to stakeholders why their direct involvement can help manage project changes more effectively.<br/>With an iterative approach described by the scenario, the interaction with stakeholders for a discussion of changes should happen on a regular and direct basis. Discussing only minor changes could water down the effect and diminish the desired benefits of a more lightweight change request process. Therefore, this answer choice is least likely to support the process change effectively.<br/></p></div></div></div></div><br/>

Customer collaboration forms the basis for the joint decision-making process. It establishes a bond between the customer and the development team, helping ensure the customer receives the intended benefits of the project. The question describes a situation where the vendor insists that product specifications are thoroughly documented in the contract even though the buyer (customer) does not have a clear picture of the requirements upfront. The vendor produces the deliverables according to the contract negotiated at the beginning of the project, but the product does not deliver the intended value/result. In some cases, a buyer is not a product expert and relies on the vendor to guide the buyer in the product design and development. This approach is an example of collaborating with the customer over rigidly adhering to specifications outlined in a contract.<br/>This principle may have prevented the problem outlined in the scenario from occurring. However, this answer choice represents a principle of the Agile Manifesto rather than one of its values.<br/>There is not enough information in the question to determine if processes and tools were valued over individuals and interactions, resulting in the buyer's dissatisfaction with the deliverables. Better collaboration between the parties would have had a more positive effect on the outcome of the project.<br/>Pair programming is a technique in which two developers work side-by-side developing software code. Continuous integration is a practice in which each team member's work products are frequently integrated and validated with one another.

Agile life cycles, on the other hand, are characterized by the progressive elaboration of requirements based on short iterative planning end executing cycles. Projects that are managed using hybrid methods combine elements of both approaches. Depending on how well or poorly the requirements are defined at the beginning of the project, the elaboration of requirements on hybrid projects will tend to either predictive or agile side of the project life cycles continuum. In any case, requirements on hybrid projects will be elaborated at periodic intervals during delivery with the time between the intervals being dependent on the level of detail of the requirements.<br/>Defining requirements during the transition to the customer make no sense. Requirements should be either defined up-front as it's done with traditionally managed projects or, at least, drafted at the beginning of the project and then progressively elaborated (with iterative projects) or at the beginning of each iteration (with agile projects).<br/>When a hybrid life cycle is selected for a project, requirements can be roughly defined up-front and then elaborated at periodic intervals during delivery. Depending on the way requirements are specified, the project hybrid life cycle may tend to be either more predictive or agile.<br/>Requirements are defined up-front before development begins in predictive, not hybrid, project life cycles. Such up-front planning is possible when requirements are stable and are unlikely to change significantly as the project progresses<br/></p></div></div></div></div><br/>

For example, a functional organizational type that is structured in silos may need to undergo a major restructuring to adopt a matrix organizational structure to support cross-functional teams. The organization may at first opt to gradually transition from waterfall to hybrid and finally to an agile approach. Alternatively, the organization may want to stop at the hybrid stage, thus benefitting from both worlds, assuming the hybrid project management approach will meet the needs of the future projects undertaken by the organization. In any case, executive management's willingness to change will be a significant factor in the transition from waterfall to hybrid to agile. Visible and active executive sponsorship will be crucial to support the significant changes that will be required for the transition to successful. The incorrect answer choices all represent agile antipatterns.<br/>Agile encourages the use of generalizing specialists over narrowly trained specialists for greater redundancy in skillsets and flexibility. Highly specialized employees will be an impediment to transforming an organization from waterfall to agile.<br/>Transitioning all projects to agile at the same time would not likely be successful.

The avoid strategy, including project cancellation, may be adopted when the level of overall project risk is significantly negative.

Transferring the risk involves shifting ownership of a threat to a third party to manage the risk and bear the impact if it occurs. Examples of risk transferring include the use of insurance, warranties, guarantees, etc. These actions typically involve payment of a risk premium to the party taking on the threat.

In risk mitigation, the action is taken to reduce the probability and/or impact of a risk – automating processes aims to do just that (assuming some project tasks can be done automatically rather than manually).

When a risk is actively accepted, its existence is acknowledged, but no immediate proactive action is taken; instead, a reserve is put in place. Hiring reserve workers are an example of risk acceptance.

Lastly, when escalating risk to management, a project team acknowledges that decision-making related to the risk is out of the project team's control and beyond their level of authority.

A bidder conference (also called a contractor conference, vendor conference, and a pre-bid conference) is one of the tools and techniques used as part of this process. The project manager should be fair to all vendors and abide by the value of fairness in the PMI Code of Ethics and Professional Conduct. Project managers should constantly re-examine their impartiality and objectivity, taking corrective action as needed. The project manager, in this scenario, should provide equal access to information to those who are authorized to have that information. The missed requirement should also be added to the project scope baseline, which requires the Perform Integrated Change Control process to be carried out, including an approved change request.

Note, a procurement SOW can be revised as required as it moves through the procurement process until incorporated into a signed agreement. After that, if the SOW requires an update, an approved changed request is needed to modify it as it is part of the agreement. While this point is not covered by the correct answer choice, updating the SOW, submitting a change request to update the scope baseline, and communicating the changes to all vendors is still the best answer of those provided.<br/>The project manager’s response may give that vendor an unfair advantage in bidding.<br/>The procurement statement of work is the description of the procurement item based on the scope baseline and should indeed be updated. The changes should be communicated to the vendors. The scope baseline is part of the project management plan and is, therefore a controlled document. This answer is incorrect since it skips the change control procedure.<br/>Another pre-bid conference is one way to communicate clearly to all vendors in fairness for the procurement process. However, since the scope baseline is part of the project management plan, it is a controlled document which cannot be updated without an approved change request. This choice skips the Perform Integrated Change Control process.<br/></p></div></div></div></div><br/>

The change management plan is a subsidiary plan of the project management plan. It provides direction to manage the change control process and documents the roles and responsibilities of the change control board (CCB) if one is used on the project. The question describes a situation in which the project manager is in the Manage Team process. One of the activities of this process involves managing team changes to optimize project performance. For example, staffing changes, whether made by choice or by uncontrollable events, can disrupt the project team (and need to be managed). To do so, the project manager may submit a change request to either replace team members who leave or outsource some of the work.<br/>Work performance reports are the physical or electronic representation of work performance information which is intended to generate decisions, actions, or awareness. The information from work performance reports and related forecasts assist in determining future team resource requirements, recognition and rewards, and updates to the resource management plan. While it is important to inform stakeholders of the change in team composition, it is not the immediate action a project manager should take in this situation.<br/>A project organizational chart is a graphic display of project team members and their reporting relationships, which is contained within the resource management plan. Since the resource management plan is a controlled document, it cannot be updated at will without an approved change request. While this step will need to be performed eventually, of the choices provided, it is not the immediate action required in this situation. Additionally, simply updating the project organizational chart would not address the need of managing the team composition as requested by the question.<br/>Since a lead architect has been forced to leave due to a conflict of interest, the project manager must now deal with the matter by submitting a change request and follow the process outlined in the change management plan to replace the human resource. The change request may be to update the resource management plan to reflect the change in team composition, to request an additional architect to replace the one that left, or possibly to outsource the project work affected by the lead architect's departure. In any case, this is the best answer choice of those provided to manage your team composition.<br/></p></div></div></div></div><br/>

It is important to distinguish the difference between formal acceptance of project deliverables in the Validate Scope process versus 'confirming' formal acceptance in the Close Project or Phase process. When closing a project, it is necessary to confirm the acceptance of all project deliverables in order to adequately complete and close the project. By doing this, the project manager is essentially 'confirming' the delivery and formal acceptance of deliverables by the client. Sometimes, this can be viewed as ticking a checkbox in the checklist of the activities carried out during project closure. It is like asking a question, ""Have the deliverables been accepted earlier in the project as part of the Validate Scope process?"". If the answer is ""Yes"", check the box. This would eventually confirm that the deliverables have already been accepted.

<br/>Based on the scenario described, the project manager is carrying out the Close Project or Phase process. Although the customer or sponsor formally accepts the completed project deliverables in the Validate Scope process, in the Close Project or Phase process, you must 'confirm' final acceptance of the project deliverables.<br/>When a PMP exam question refers to procurements, it does this from the perspective of a buyer. In this scenario, the buyer is the client, and you are the seller. Therefore, settling procurement claims is not applicable in this scenario. Theoretically, if the project manager, as a seller, subcontracted part of the work to a vendor, then the project manager would have to settle procurement claims as specified in the contract with the vendor. However, there is not enough information in the question to determine whether or not contracts with vendors have been used on in the project. Even if the question referred to the procurement claims between the seller and the client as a buyer, these claims would have been settled using the claims administration technique as part of the Control Procurements process, which should have been completed before project closure. Based on all the above considerations, settling procurement claims is not the best answer to the question asked.<br/>The Validate Scope process is the process of formalizing acceptance of the completed project deliverables. This answer choice is incorrect for a couple of reasons. First, the scenario states that the client has already formally accepted the work. Secondly, the Validate Scope process is part of the Monitoring and Controlling Process Group and not part of project closure as implied by the scenario.<br/></p></div></div></div></div><br/>

Stakeholders should be kept engaged throughout the project life cycle. The question implies the project manager is performing the Monitor Stakeholder Engagement process. Meetings are among the tools and techniques used in this process. Types of meetings include status meetings, standup meetings, retrospectives, and any other meetings as agreed upon in the stakeholder engagement plan to monitor and assess stakeholder engagement levels. A retrospective is a scheduled review to record lessons learned. The project manager should hold a release retrospective to analyze the feedback that has been provided by the early adopters and take necessary actions to improve the product (the computer game) in the upcoming releases. The knowledge gained should then be captured in the lessons learned register and used in the current project as well as entered into the lessons learned repository for use in future projects. Therefore, of the available options, the best course of action for the project manager is to hold a retrospective to analyze the feedback that has been provided and incorporate the knowledge gained into future releases.

Note, the fact the scenario describes an agile project does not change the correct answer. Holding retrospectives (or lessons learned meetings) is a good practice that can be adopted by any project regardless of the project management methodology used.<br/>A retrospective is a scheduled review to record lessons learned. The project manager should hold a release retrospective to analyze the feedback that has been provided by the early adopters and incorporate the knowledge gained into future releases.<br/>If the gaming community rejects the game, then the project may be terminated before delivering the final release. However, terminating the project at this point in the project is a premature action. The project manager should seek to understand the feedback that has already been provided and use the knowledge gained to incorporate into future releases.<br/>The project sponsor may or may not need to be notified of the initial customer reviews depending on what is documented in the communications management plan. However, discussing the matter with the project sponsor will not better align the game design with the expectations of the gaming community.<br/></p></div></div></div></div><br/>

These team ground rules should be agreed upon and then documented in the form of a team charter. The rules can be revised as needed throughout the project. According to the scenario, the project will combine agile and waterfall methodologies, making the overall project management approach hybrid. When transitioning from agile to waterfall, the team's working agreements may need to be revised to reflect the differences in how the team members will interact. Agile teams are self-organizing and self-managing. Therefore, when parts of a project are executed with an agile methodology (as is the case with the development phase of this project), the entire team is collectively responsible for the deliverables. However, when using a waterfall framework (as is the case with the rollout phase), the project manager is more likely to assign tasks to specific individuals, making them individually accountable for completing their assigned tasks. Therefore, the team charter should reflect these changes in group responsibility versus individual responsibility as the team transitions from agile to waterfall.<br/>With agile methodologies, the entire project team is responsible for the project's deliverables. In this scenario, the project is transitioning from agile to waterfall. Therefore, it is more likely that the project's tasks will be assigned to specific individuals rather than collectively owned by the team.<br/>A set of working agreements from past waterfall projects might be useful as a template for the team to create their own team charter. However, the team will need to customize the charter to suit their unique situation. The project manager might provide guidance for the charter, but should not dictate the team's working agreements.<br/>Having each team member develop their own social contract would not be very helpful as the team needs a common set of values rather than individual values.

For instance, the agreement to share data with the university in this scenario might be documented as an MOU.<br/>The business case is one of the business documents, and the question states that the business documents have already been reviewed.

While this can definitely be true in real-life situations, the idea, while taking the exam, is to find the 'best match' even if it does not look/sound to be a perfect/ideal combination.

For example, project sponsors are commonly high-ranking managers who endorse and provide political support for the completion of a project; therefore, a project sponsor would likely be interested in organizational requirements being met.

Those who will use the project deliverables (e.g., the software product developed by the project) are primarily interested in the product features; hence, the functional requirements are likely to be the central interest of the end users.

The foremost concern of data security experts is to make sure the product meets security requirements, policies, and regulations, making non-functional requirements the best match for their area of interest/expertise.

Project team members, such as developers, may be interested to see that the technical requirements are properly implemented.

For project managers, seeing the whole picture is their main focus.

This situation is driving the client to submit change requests, which must be reviewed by the change control board (CCB). Projects, where the product under development is expected to evolve throughout the project, can be said to have unstable requirements. The stability of requirements should be considered to determine the appropriate development approach. In this case, it is apparent that the strict change control processes and procedures of a traditional waterfall approach are not well suited to the needs of the client who is forced to submit change requests as the product changes and evolves. In this circumstance, an agile approach may have been more appropriate for the project. An agile approach welcomes change and harnesses it for the customer's benefit. Had you, as the project manager, considered the stability (or, in this case, instability) of the product requirements, you may have selected an approach more appropriate for the project. For example, the project, at a high level, could have still been lead using waterfall, but the actual development of the product performed by the team could have been carried out using agile, thus making the whole project hybrid.

Note, the development approach is also a tailoring consideration for the scope management processes, but it was not offered as an answer choice. Therefore, of the available options, the stability of requirements is the best answer to the question asked.<br/>The diverse background of the team is an important consideration in resource management, but it is not very relevant to controlling scope. Additionally, there is no information presented by the question to suggest that a diversity issue exists in the project.<br/>The stability of requirements should be considered to determine the appropriate development approach. In this case, it is apparent that the change control requirements of a traditional waterfall approach are not well suited to the needs of the client who is forced to submit change requests as the product changes and evolves.<br/>Physical location is a tailoring consideration associated with the resource management processes rather than the scope management processes. Additionally, the physical location of team members and resources is not likely to create the problem of excessive change requests.<br/></p></div></div></div></div><br/>

In the scenario, the project manager needs to develop a schedule for the first release, which will establish the number of iterations required. Since there is a potential impact on the schedule from another project, the project manager should analyze the impact and take the findings into account when developing the release plan for the current project. The assessment and evaluation of this impact could be done using the what-if scenario analysis, which is an example of the data analysis technique that can be used as part of the Develop Schedule process implied by the scenario. The what-if scenario analysis may typically help assess the feasibility of the project schedule under different conditions, thus allowing the project manager to make an informed decision as to the number of iterations required before the rollout.<br/>Agile release planning determines the number of iterations in the release and helps decide how much needs to be developed and how long it will take to have a releasable product based on business goals, dependencies, and impediments. A company-wide operating system upgrade described by the scenario represents a dependency, thus requiring the project manager to analyze its impact on the release planning of the ERP project.<br/>A product roadmap shows the anticipated sequence of deliverables over time. In agile release planning, the product roadmap drives the release plans. While it may be important to evaluate the overall feasibility of the roadmap in the scenario described, the number of iterations, as requested by the question, is determined at the release level, not the product roadmap level.<br/>An iteration backlog is a prioritized list of items (requirements, features, user stories) to be developed in an iteration. The iteration length is typically fixed and not determined by its content. The number of iterations in a release is determined by the iteration length and the time available until the rollout, rather than the content of iteration backlogs. Therefore, assessing the impact of the upgrade project on the iteration backlogs of the current project would not help determine the number of the iterations until rollout.<br/></p></div></div></div></div><br/>

XP is most commonly associated with software development but might be used for other types of deliverables, as well. One of the hallmarks of XP is the use of pair programming. With pair programming, two members of the development work in tandem, where one writes the code, and the other reviews each line of code as it is entered. The two programmers then switch roles frequently. Since there is a budgetary constraint that does not permit the development team members to be physically colocated, you, as the project manager, will need to provide accommodations to support XP practices, including pair programming. Additionally, the members of the predictive team will need to collaborate with each other, and both teams will likely need to coordinate their activities. Providing video conferencing capabilities will support the collaboration requirements in a virtual environment.<br/>eXtreme Programming (XP) is one of the methodologies that falls under the agile umbrella. Agile teams do not typically require a communications management plan as the communication methods are inherent in the agile ceremonies. Although a communications management plan might or might not be helpful for the XP team, it is not the most critical element of the options provided that should be prioritized.<br/>One of the primary practices associated with eXtreme Programming (XP) is pair programming. A project manager will need to replicate this practice in a virtual environment. Additionally, the predictive team members will need to collaborate with each other, and both teams will likely need to coordinate their activities. Providing video conferencing capabilities will support the collaboration requirements in a virtual environment.<br/> A caves and common approach is a method of delineating workspace, so a development team has a common area for close collaboration and private areas where team members can work without distractions. Although one might argue that caves and common can be recreated in a virtual environment, this approach is typically employed when teams are collocated, which is not the case in this scenario.<br/></p></div></div></div></div><br/>

Since the question is asking for an antipattern, the incorrect answer choices represent actions that are consistent with best practices or techniques associated with root cause analysis. In this case, attempting to maximize the number of action items is considered an antipattern. Assigning too many action items aimed to resolve a problem may cause a distraction from performing the most important actions that may produce the best results. It is better to pick the top one or two actions and focus efforts on those that are most likely to be effective.

Note, the scenario describes a hybrid project that involves elements from both the traditional/predictive project management approach and agile. The fact the project manager is involved in the project who schedules and leads a meeting with the team, product owner, and other stakeholders indicate that the project is using a predictive project management approach. The use of iterations, the fact a product owner is involved in the acceptance of the product increments developed by the team are an indication that this part of the project is managed using the agile project management approach. While this information does not change the correct answer, it is important to understand that projects can be managed using various approaches, including predictive (sometimes called traditional or waterfall), agile (Scrum, Kanban, etc.), or hybrid which is a combination of both.<br/>A fishbone diagram is a common type of cause-and-effect diagram that is used for root cause analysis. Utilizing a fishbone diagram would not be considered an antipattern.<br/>The five whys method is a technique where repeatedly asking ""why?"" breaks down the identified problem to identify the root cause. Convention suggests that five iterations are required to drill down to the root cause of the problem. The five whys method is a common form of root cause analysis and would not be considered an antipattern.<br/>Maximizing the number of action items may not be an effective method of resolving the identified problem. For the greatest effectiveness, the meeting participants should focus on the most important action items rather than on the number of action items.<br/></p></div></div></div></div><br/>

</div></div> </div></div></div><div class='answer'><a class='ans' onclick='showHide(107)'>Ans</a><p style='display:none;' id='ans_107'>4--The way to forecast velocity is to run an iteration (or two, or three) and then calculate the average velocity based on the story points completed during each of the iterations. In this situation, the project team’s current average velocity is 30 story points. In this scenario, to calculate the number of iterations required to complete the remaining portion of the project, the number of story points remaining (292 story points) needs to be divided by the average velocity (30 story points). 292 divided by 30 results in 9.74 iterations. Therefore, at the current velocity, it should take another 10 iterations to complete the project.

Please note, the result should be rounded to 10, not because of the math rules, but rather because there is no such thing as half iteration, or quarter iteration (or any other portion of iteration). Therefore, even if the result were 9.1, the answer would be the same: it should take 10 iterations for the team to complete the project.<br/>If the average velocity for the team is 30 story points, then, if the current velocity is maintained, the team would only be able to complete 210 (the product of 7 and 30) of the remaining 292 story points after the next 7 iterations.<br/>The scenario indicates that the average velocity for the team stands at 30 story points. At the current velocity of 30 story points, the team could expect to complete 240 (the product of 8 and 30) story points of the remaining 292 after 8 additional iterations. The team would need to experience a significant increase in velocity to complete the project in only 8 iterations, and there is no information presented that would suggest that the velocity might increase for the remainder of the project.<br/>The average velocity of the team is stated at 30 story points. At the current velocity, the team can expect to complete 30 story points for each of the remaining iterations. Thus, 9 iterations should yield 270 completed story points (the product of 9 and 30). Therefore, unless the team experiences an increase in velocity, an additional iteration will be necessary to complete the remaining 22 story points.<br/></p></div></div></div></div><br/>

In cases where the project scope will evolve throughout project execution, the scope and schedule may be adjusted to stay within the cost constraint. This approach is typically applied to projects lead using agile methods where the product backlog constitutes the project scope that is defined and redefined throughout the project. Thus, of the available choices, adding prioritized features with each release until the budget is exhausted is the correct answer.<br/>The scenario in the question is that the project scope will evolve based on feedback from the focus group for each subsequent release. Since much of the scope is unknown at the start of the project, this is not suited to a traditional or predictive approach like waterfall.<br/>With an adaptive approach where the cost is fixed, the schedule and scope must be adjusted to stay within the cost constraint.<br/>The question describes that the project scope is not known and will be based on feedback from a focus group. As such, it will not be possible to develop a realistic budget for each release without knowing what features will be developed.<br/></p></div></div></div></div><br/>

One of the typical activities performed while developing the charter is to review organizational process assets (OPAs), which may influence this process. One of the OPAs is the project governance framework which often provides information about the governance functions, processes, that are important when making decisions that are relevant to the project charter.

One may argue that a stakeholder register can be created at the same time the project charter is developed and approved. While it's true, the question is asking to select the answer choice that represents an action performed 'during this process'. Since the scenario describes the Develop Project Charter process, any action that is associated with 'this process' would be a better option than an action associated with 'another process', even if that process can be done in parallel with the one described in the scenario. Therefore, as we always recommend selecting the best answer of those provided, studying the governance functions and processes to provide guidance and decision making is a better answer choice than identifying stakeholders and preparing the stakeholder register since the former is associated with the inputs to the Develop Project Charter process while the latter is not even part of this process.<br/>The question implies that you, as the project manager, are conducting the Develop Project Charter process. The stakeholder register is developed during the Identify Stakeholders process and not the Develop Project Charter process.<br/>The project governance framework is part of the organizational process assets (OPA), which serve as an input into the Develop Project Charter process.<br/>The project manager may make recommendations but does not update or modify the business documents since they are not project documents.<br/></p></div></div></div></div><br/>

Therefore, conflict management is one of the most important interpersonal and team skills that project managers have to master. The success of project managers in managing their project teams often depends on their ability to resolve conflict. In the scenario described, the conflict is between the project manager and the team. The conflict is at the level that negatively impacts the team's morale and jeopardizes the project's goals. However, selecting the appropriate conflict resolution technique depends on the project manager and the circumstances surrounding the conflict. Under different circumstances, different project managers may use different conflict resolution methods. Factors that influence these methods include the importance and intensity of the conflict, time pressure for resolving the conflict, relative power of the people involved in the conflict, importance of maintaining a good relationship, motivation to resolve conflict on a long-term or short-term basis, etc.

There are five general techniques for resolving conflict: withdrawal/avoiding, smoothing/accommodating, compromising/reconciling, forcing/directing, collaborating/problem-solving. In the scenario, the project manager decides to solve the conflict. There is not enough information in the scenario to determine whether the project manager's decision was right or wrong. However, this information is not required to answer the question correctly. All that is needed to select the correct answer is to understand the various degrees of desire to satisfy the concerns of the parties involved in the conflict and map the desire to the technique described in the scenario, keeping in mind that the scenario is presented from the project manager's perspective.<br/>Area A represents a low desire to satisfy team members' concerns but a high desire to satisfy the project manager's own concerns. From the project manager's perspective, this would be a force/direct technique, in which the project manager would push his/her viewpoint at the expense of the team, offering a win-lose solution. In the scenario described, the project manager decides to solve the conflict, making this an incorrect choice.<br/>Area B represents a high desire to satisfy team members' concerns as well as a high desire to satisfy the project manager's own concerns. From the project manager's perspective, this would be a collaborate/problem-solve technique, in which multiple viewpoints and insights from different perspectives are incorporated. This approach typically results in a win-win situation. In the scenario described, the project manager decides to solve the conflict, making this choice the best answer to the question asked.<br/>Area C represents a low desire to satisfy team members' concerns as well as a low desire to satisfy the project manager's own concerns. From the project manager's perspective, this would be an avoid/withdraw technique, in which parties retreat from an actual or potential conflict situation, postponing the issue to be better prepared or to be resolved by others. In the scenario described, the project manager decides to solve the conflict, making this choice an incorrect answer.<br/></p></div></div></div></div><br/>

The other answer choices are also techniques used in the Control Resources process but based on the specific actions being described in this scenario; alternatives analysis emerges as the best choice.

Note, the PMBOK® Guide refers to Control Resource as a process concerned with physical resources, while the question describes a scenario with human resources which is typically addressed by the Manage Team process. The fact the alternatives analysis technique is associated with the Control Resource process and not the Manage Team process does not mean the technique cannot be used in other processes to resolve issues the project manager is facing. In the scenario provided, the discussion the project manager is having with the team members regarding different options such as authorizing additional overtime, hiring subcontractors, or bringing in additional resources from another project team within the company is best described by the alternatives analysis technique. Therefore, among the available choices, alternatives analysis, while not ideal, is the best answer to the question asked.<br/>This type of analysis focuses on determining the best corrective action in terms of cost, but there is no indication from the question that cost was the major determining factor in the decision.<br/>Alternatives analysis is a technique of the Control Resources process used to select the best resolution for correcting variances in resource utilization. Alternatives may include paying additional for overtime or additional team resources and weighing these alternatives against a late delivery or other factors.<br/>Problem solving involves taking methodical steps to deal with a problem. Those steps include: identifying, investigating, and analyzing the problem; choosing a solution; and checking the solution to determine if the problem has been fixed.

Sometimes it is advantageous to use different project management frameworks for different phases of a project, meaning the project is taking a hybrid approach. Project teams typically collaborate in a different way when using predictive versus agile methodologies. Thus, it is likely that the project team will need to revise their working agreements to be tailored to the project management framework.
Agile teams are known for being self-organizing, and, as a result, have collective ownership for delivering the project's deliverables. With a waterfall project, the project team members are more likely to be assigned specific tasks and are individually accountable for completing their assignments. Agile, on the other hand, and XP specifically, stresses the importance of collective code ownership (as it applies to software development). This collective responsibility and team accountability may need to be included as part of the social contract, as reflected by the ground rules in the team charter.<br/>Teams that utilize an eXtreme Programming (XP) method to develop the product (typically a software product) are bound by collective responsibility for delivering the project's deliverables.<br/>There is no indication from the question that the project team will be transitioning to a virtual environment. Additionally, agile best practices encourage the use of colocated teams. Therefore, transitioning to an agile framework, all else being equal, is more likely to move away from a virtual environment in favor of face-to-face communication.<br/>The ground rules can be useful regardless of the project management framework being employed. The ground rules may need to be revised for use in an agile environment but are not likely to be discarded.<br/></p></div></div></div></div><br/>

</div></div> </div></div></div><div class='answer'><a class='ans' onclick='showHide(115)'>Ans</a><p style='display:none;' id='ans_115'>1--Open, frequent, and informal communication is the cornerstone of agile managed projects. The best form of communication is face to face conversations. Agile teams working in a collocated space that supports communication is ideal. Planning communications management that hinders or places boundaries on those conversations is counterproductive. A project manager needs to encourage more communication, not less. A project manager also needs to support the capturing and flow of communication between stakeholders. Scheduling more communication checkpoints, such as daily standup meetings, increases the communication exchanges. And, when possible, posting and distributing information to the team aids communication flow - whether in physical locations, digitized, or both. Withholding conversations or enforcing extended quiet times is the antithesis of good communication flow.<br/>Frequent and flexible information exchanges are good for agile management projects. An open work arrangement supports that. Offering checkpoint times, posting information, and other ways to support the sharing and access to information extends the free flow of project knowledge and communications.<br/>Agile managed projects thrive on open, constant face to face conversations amongst stakeholders. Holding conversations to designated meeting times hinders the free flow of information and the informal exchanges that occur regularly in agile projects.<br/>With so many conversations occurring daily, capturing them all, storing them, and distributing them in a manner that would be relevant, useful, and not out of date would be highly unlikely and counterproductive.<br/></p></div></div></div></div><br/>

This estimation technique is called parametric estimating. Parametric estimating can be used during the Estimate Activity Durations process, which is what is described in the question scenario. For example, since the previous project was able to install one mile of guardrail over 10 days, he could estimate that five miles of guardrail will take 50 days to install.

<br/>Parametric estimating uses an algorithm to calculate duration based on historical data and project parameters. Since the project manager has the duration parameters from previous projects, he can use them to calculate a duration estimate for this project. Parametric estimating can provide high levels of accuracy depending on the complexity of the variables.<br/>A good option, but parametric estimating is a better choice because the project manager has comparable parameters to more accurately calculate the estimate. Analogous estimating is a gross-level estimating technique which relies on the actual duration of previous, similar projects. Also, analogous estimating is generally less accurate than other estimating techniques.<br/>Bottom-up estimating is a method of estimating duration by aggregating the estimates of the lower level components of the work breakdown structure. Bottom-up estimating is typically used when estimates cannot be made with a high degree of confidence. Since the project manager has duration data from a similar project with definitive parameters that allow him to provide estimates with a high degree of confidence, bottom-up estimating is not the best answer in this scenario.<br/></p></div></div></div></div><br/>

On agile projects, this role is frequently performed by a product owner. The product owner serves as the voice of the customer and needs to work closely with the development team to ensure that the team's efforts remain in alignment with project goals. The lack of involvement from a business analyst/product owner can lead to slower development and rework. Although the scrum master has reached out to the business analyst and requested them to work with the team in the upcoming sprints, this does not mean that the issue will not recur. An effective leader should identify potential problems and address them proactively. Since the business analyst's lack of involvement has been identified as an issue, the scrum master should continue to monitor the business analyst's involvement to ensure that the project work can continue without disruption.

Note, the scenario describes a project in which the project scope is managed using the traditional/predictive project management approach (e.g., work package) while the work is carried out using the Scrum framework (sprints). This means the project as a whole is managed in a hybrid way. While this information does not change the correct answer, it is important to understand that projects can be managed using various approaches, including predictive (sometimes called traditional or waterfall), agile (Scrum, Kanban, etc.), or hybrid which is a combination of both.<br/>It is unclear if the problem has been resolved. All the scrum master did was reaching out to the business analyst and requesting them to collaborate with the team during the upcoming sprints. The problem will be considered resolved only when it's evident the business analyst is available for the team when needed.<br/>It is not uncommon that an organization may have resource constraints resulting in some of the resources being unavailable and, consequently, unresponsive at times. An individual being unavailable and/or unresponsive, though, is unlikely to be considered as one who violates work ethics.<br/>Even though it appears that the current issue has been addressed, a good proactive leader is expected to continue monitoring issues to ensure they do not reoccur going forward.<br/></p></div></div></div></div><br/>

The fact the project still uses some elements of the waterfall to make the transition easier implies the project, as a whole, is hybrid. While retrospectives are typically associated with the agile project management framework, they can be used on any project, whether it is managed using waterfall/predictive, agile, or hybrid methodology. Retrospectives can be used to investigate issues and provide the project team an opportunity to learn from its previous work. Retrospectives allow the team members to improve and adapt their processes. During the iteration retrospective, the project team has the opportunity to discuss the issue of duplicate efforts and then adjust their practices to avoid the issue from happening in the upcoming iterations.

Note, the scenario does not specify what duplicate efforts exactly are there on the project. This information, however, is not required to answer the question. The idea is, as always, under the circumstances described in this particular scenario and with the given set of the available answer choices, to select the best answer to the question asked. In this case, bringing up the topic during the upcoming iteration retrospective is the best answer to the question asked.<br/>Regularly scheduled retrospectives can be used on any project, predictive, agile, hybrid. Retrospectives provide the project team an opportunity to learn from its previous work, investigate issues, and improve and adapt their processes.<br/>Project managers are responsible to do everything in their power to make the projects they are leading successful. Duplication of efforts may lead to a waste of project resources thus reducing the chances of the project's success. Therefore, doing nothing is unlikely to be the correct answer.<br/> It is unclear if switching to a waterfall project management framework would resolve the issue of duplicate work. Regardless, this is an extreme response to a relatively minor issue. The project manager should not overreact and revert back to using a waterfall approach, but rather address the issue from within the agile or hybrid framework.<br/></p></div></div></div></div><br/>

Scrum is one of the agile methods. Agile methods place a great emphasis on collaboration, a sentiment reflected in the Agile Manifesto that values customer collaboration over contract negotiation. Agile methods are typically selected for projects where the project scope cannot be well-defined at the start of the project and will be progressively elaborated as the project progresses. As a result, collaboration becomes a critical factor in the project's success. In this scenario, the question is asking for the contracting technique that will maximize collaboration with the vendor. With a team augmentation approach, the supplier's services are embedded directly into the customer's organization. Having the development team comprised of internal and external resources, working as a cohesive unit, best supports the collaborative efforts.<br/>Team augmentation is an approach where the supplier's services are embedded directly into the customer's organization. Colocating the supplier's services with the customer will enhance collaboration.<br/>Including an early cancellation option in the contract is probably a good idea for an agile project. However, the question is specifically asking about how to maximize collaboration with the vendor. An early cancellation option has nothing to do with enhancing collaboration.<br/>A fixed-price increments contracting technique allows the buyer to decompose the project scope into fixed-price micro-deliverables. This technique provides benefits to both the buyer and the seller/vendor, such as control over how the money is spent (for the buyer) and limiting the financial risk (for the seller).

Since one of the answer choices is for the project manager to abide by whatever is in the change management plan, you can eliminate the other answer choices since those options may contradict the change management plan. For example, in this scenario, if the change management plan grants authority to the project manager to authorize certain types of change requests, then it would be unnecessary for the project manager to go through the change control board for approval. However, to make this determination, the change management plan should be consulted. In order to answer this question correctly, one needs to understand that project managers should handle change requests in accordance with the change management plan.<br/>Change requests should be processed according to the change management plan. Depending on the change management plan, you, as project manager, may or may not have the authority to make the final decision on change requests, regardless of your expertise.<br/>You should follow the process outlined in the change management plan. Assuming that you are not a member of the change control board (CCB) in this scenario, it may be inappropriate for you to circumvent the change control meetings process to try and influence their decision. The CCB should make the ultimate decision as to what, if any, changes are to be made to the project based on their expert judgment and the information presented in the actual change request.<br/>You should follow the process outlined in the change management plan. However, since that process was not given in the question, it is possible that the change management plan allows you, as project manager, under certain conditions, to make the final decision.

Pair programming is an agile software development technique from eXtreme Programming (XP) in which two developers work side-by-side in tandem at the same workstation. While one programmer writes the code, the other reviews the code as it is entered. The two then switch roles frequently. With pair programming, the feedback loop is immediate. If a developer enters a coding error, their partner has the opportunity to catch the error where it can be fixed immediately. Thus, of the available responses, pair programming offers the feedback loop with the shortest interval.<br/>While shortening the iteration length would allow the team to gain feedback from the QA department earlier in comparison to the current cadence, agile best practices discourage changing the iteration length in the middle of a project.<br/>Since the testing is done at the end of each iteration, reducing the size of the user stories would not progress work items from development to testing quicker. The QA department would still have to wait until all the user stories in the iteration are completed whether the user stories are big, medium, or small. Additionally, it's up to the team, not the project manager, to determine whether a user story should be split.<br/>According to the scenario, there are already delays to the project schedule. Therefore, it is reasonable to assume that the schedule baseline will need to be revised. However, this action would not shorten the feedback loop, as requested by the question.<br/></p></div></div></div></div><br/>

Team members in successful agile teams work to collaborate in various ways, such as pairing, swarming, and mobbing. Swarming is a technique in which multiple team members focus collectively on resolving a specific impediment. This results in work getting done quickly. Having said that, swarming should not be the default working mode, because each team member has their own work planned for the sprint. Therefore, it is unclear if swarming on all work planned for the sprint would result in a better outcome as compared to each team member completing their own work. However, based on the situation, such as the one described in the scenario, in which there is only one team member encountering an issue with one user story, swarming could be very helpful in achieving the sprint goal.<br/>High-performing agile teams are characterized by strong collaboration among the team members allowing them to achieve sprint/release/project goals. When one team member encounters an impediment/issue, some or all other team members may swarm (work collectively) on the task and help resolve the issue.<br/>There is not enough information in the scenario to determine if the team member has been consistently underperforming and was notified multiple times. Therefore, replacing the team member just because she was unable to resolve an issue is an overreaction and is not aligned with agile best practices of servant leadership and valuing people.<br/>Assuming the user story is unclear, it would make sense to request the product owner to clarify it. However, the scenario states that the issue encountered by the team member is of a technical nature. While the product owner may have the technical expertise, requesting the product owner to resolve the issue just because the product owner is the one who wrote the user story makes little sense.<br/></p></div></div></div></div><br/>

</div></div> </div></div></div><div class='answer'><a class='ans' onclick='showHide(126)'>Ans</a><p style='display:none;' id='ans_126'>4--The question suggests that the Manage Stakeholder Engagement process is underway. Various meetings can be beneficial in this process including the iteration retrospective. An iteration retrospective is a specialized type of meeting used on projects with an agile framework and is conducted at the end of each iteration. The purpose of a retrospective is to cover project progress thus far and determine what worked well, what did not work well, and how project performance can be improved going forward. Inviting the key stakeholders to the iteration retrospective will allow the project team to address any concerns the stakeholders may have and develop a plan to ensure the problems encountered do not recur. This approach should be beneficial in reassuring the stakeholders that positive action is being taken to bring the project back into alignment with project goals. Additionally, the iteration retrospective is held throughout project execution at the end of each iteration. The ability of stakeholders to influence the project is typically highest during the initiating stage and gets lower as the project progresses. The incorrect answer choices represent meetings that are held at the end of the project and/or are not relevant to the Manage Stakeholder Engagement Process.

Note, even though in ""pure"" agile environment, the iteration retrospective meetings are typically held by and for the team members with an agile leader (such as a scrum master or an agile coach), other project stakeholders can be invited as necessary. Therefore, while not ideal, of the available choices, the iteration retrospective would be the most beneficial for key stakeholders to attend as it pertains to the Manage Stakeholder Engagement process.<br/>The customer wrap-up meeting occurs at the end of the project. The level of influence of project stakeholders is the lowest at the end of the project. With the project halfway complete and project support in jeopardy, it would be best to take more immediate action and not wait until the end of the project. While the customer wrap-up meeting may be required for certain stakeholders, it is not the most beneficial meeting from the standpoint of managing stakeholder engagement.<br/>Change control meetings are held with a change control board (CCB) that is responsible for meeting and reviewing the change requests and approving, rejecting, or deferring change requests. It is not known from the description provided by the question if a CCB has been authorized by the project management plan. Even if the project utilizes a CCB, the focus of the meeting is to review and dispose change requests, which is unlikely to have the desired effect on stakeholder engagement.<br/>A celebration meeting usually occurs at the end of a project to reward the project team and celebrate the success of the project. The celebration meeting may also include key stakeholders. However, at the conclusion of a project is when stakeholders have the least influence on the outcome of the project, making the celebration meeting of lesser importance for managing stakeholder engagement compared with meetings conducted earlier in the project. Additionally, the scenario describes a project that has been experiencing issues. It is not clear yet if there will be anything to celebrate.<br/></p></div></div></div></div><br/>

Since the performing organization has a great deal of experience with traditional construction methods, these aspects of the project represent little uncertainty and risk. However, the organization does not have experience with solar shingles and energy storage, making these aspects of the project high uncertainty and risk. One method of managing the uncertainty and risk is to combine a predictive project management framework with an incremental approach, resulting in a hybrid project. The construction of each home can follow the traditional waterfall framework, but also incorporate an incremental approach by building one home at a time (sequentially). Using the incremental approach and conducting a retrospective after the completion of each deliverable (similarly to how this process is carried out on agile projects) will provide the opportunity for lessons learned to be applied to each subsequent deliverable (home), thus providing opportunities for continuous improvement throughout project execution.<br/>Adopting an incremental approach by constructing the homes sequentially and, after each consecutive home is built, learning what went well and what should be improved will allow the project team to gain valuable information that can be applied to the construction of the subsequent homes in the development.<br/>Reviewing the organization's lessons learned repository might yield some useful information regarding home construction. However, the question indicates that this will be the organization's first project incorporating solar panels and energy storage. Thus, it is highly unlikely that the lessons learned repository will have information regarding energy generation and storage, which represents the highest risk and uncertainty for the project.<br/>Updating the lessons learned register continuously is a proper project management practice. However, building all of the homes concurrently would not provide an opportunity for lessons learned to be applied to the current project. For example, if the solar shingles are installed on all of the homes at the same time, any mistakes or poor practices would likely be duplicated across all of the homes.<br/></p></div></div></div></div><br/>

While it is beneficial for the teams to maintain their composition, ensuring that team members 'never' leave their teams is unlikely to be the correct answer. Sometimes, new team members who replace veterans can bring views that may eventually advantageous for the team.<br/>Through support, encouragement, and professional development, team members gain confidence, take on more significant roles, and contribute at higher levels within their organizations. Sometimes, team members that outgrew their roles would seek opportunities outside the organization. This can be considered a negative result of the approach described in the scenario. Smart organizations, however, know to retain their star employees.<br/>Limiting the development of team members would have a negative effect on the personal performance of the individuals as well as the overall team performance. This may retain the people for the short term. However, in the long run, it is reasonable to assume that the team members would feel the lack of their personal and professional development and eventually leave.<br/></p></div></div></div></div><br/>

On agile projects, changes are typically driven by stakeholder needs. When new stakeholders are identified during an ongoing project, the stakeholders should be engaged as soon as possible. One of the earliest opportunities for that engagement is at the sprint review meeting. At the sprint review meetings, the team presents the product increment that they have built during the sprint. According to Rawsthorne and Shimp, the sprint review is conducted for three main reasons:

To prove to the stakeholders that the team is moving in the right direction;
To get feedback from the stakeholders about the work completed; and
To discuss the work of the next sprint with the stakeholders.
One may argue that work to be completed during the next sprint is discussed at the sprint planning meeting, not sprint review. While it's generally true, at the sprint review, the discussion of the work to be performed for the next sprint is done at a high-level only and does not replace the sprint planning meeting. It is at the sprint planning meeting that the sprint goal is defined after the team forecasts what they can deliver on that sprint. Of the choices provided, only discussing what is to be worked on in the next sprint is the most plausible answer to the question asked.<br/>Team performance is discussed at the sprint retrospective meeting, not the sprint review meeting described in the scenario. Typically, stakeholders do not attend sprint retrospective meetings.<br/>The prioritization of user stories, regardless of whether they are high-risk or not, for the next sprint typically happens at the sprint planning meeting. The scenario, however, describes the sprint review meeting.<br/>An agile release encompasses several sprints. The release backlog is comprised of the items to be developed during those sprints. Each sprint has its own sprint planning meeting. The release backlog is prioritized during the release planning meeting, not the sprint planning meeting, and not the sprint 'review' meeting described in the scenario.<br/></p></div></div></div></div><br/>

Specifically, it can be implied that the team carries out the Estimate Costs process. Reserve analysis is an example of the data analysis tools and techniques applicable to this process. Cost estimates may include contingency reserves to account for cost uncertainty. The project team has decided to set aside a contingency reserve for the potential risk of possible technological advances that, if realized, would make their equipment obsolete. According to the scenario, the project is in planning. Since there is no information stating that the project management plan has already been approved, one can make the reasonable assumption that project baselines have not yet been finalized. As a result, the best course of action for the project manager is creating a contingency reserve.<br/>A management reserve is an amount of the project budget or project schedule that is held outside of the performance measurement baseline (PMB) for management control purposes and is reserved for unforeseen work that is within the scope of the project. In other words, a management reserve is a predefined amount of time and/or money set aside for unknown risk events. It typically requires approval from someone above the project manager’s authority level, such as the project sponsor. As the risk event described in the scenario is known, it would not mandate the creation of a management reserve, but a contingency reserve.<br/>Be sure to look out for the word ‘planning’ in this question. At this stage in the project, it can be reasonably assumed that the project management plan has not yet been approved. Therefore, no change request is required.<br/>According to the scenario, the project is in planning. Therefore, one may assume the project baselines have yet been finalized.

A spike is a timeboxed research aimed to gain knowledge in situations where there is a lack of clarity in areas of estimation, acceptance criteria definition, the flow of user's actions, the technology to be selected, and so on. Spikes may help when the team needs to learn some critical technical or functional elements, as in the scenario described. A spike is an experiment performed quickly to help the team decide which path to take. Of the two spikes used in agile, namely risk-based or architectural, the scenario requires the latter. An architectural spike is a technical timeboxed experiment popularized by eXtreme Programming (XP) where the team writes just enough code to explore the use of an unfamiliar technology or technique.<br/>A risk-based spike is a short, time-boxed effort that is used to investigate and hopefully reduce or eliminate an issue or threat to the project.

</div></div> </div></div></div><div class='answer'><a class='ans' onclick='showHide(136)'>Ans</a><p style='display:none;' id='ans_136'>3--The project in the scenario is using an agile methodology which focuses on small batches of work and allows the team to uncover inconsistencies and quality issues earlier in the project life cycle. Quality is managed by scheduling regular retrospectives to check on the effectiveness of the quality processes. During a retrospective, root causes of issues are sought, and new approaches are suggested to improve the development process in general and quality in particular. Subsequent retrospectives evaluate any new approaches to determine if they are working and should be continued, need adjusting, or should be dropped from use. Therefore, of the available choices, scheduling regular retrospectives is the best way for the project manager to manage quality on his project which is being conducted using agile practices.

<br/>A quality audit is a structured independent process to determine if project activities comply with organizational and project policies, processes, and procedures. While it's important to conduct quality audits, the question is asking about the best way to manage quality in the project environment described in the scenario. The scenario describes a project which is managed using agile methodologies where recurring retrospectives, rather than audits, are the best practice to check on the effectiveness of the quality processes.<br/>Validate Scope is the process of formalizing acceptance of the completed project deliverables. The project in the scenario is using agile methodology where requirements, or scope, is defined and redefined throughout the project. Since the scope is defined iteratively, the Validate Scope process, in its traditional or waterfall meaning, is not performed. Additionally, even if the question was about a traditional project, the Manage Quality and Control Quality processes, not the Validate Scope process, are used to manage quality on a project.<br/>Retrospectives are recurring meetings that are intended to regularly check on the effectiveness of the quality processes. Retrospectives are typically used on projects that are conducted using agile methodologies. Since the scenario describes an agile environment, using recurring retrospectives would be the best tool for the project manager to use on his project to manage quality.<br/></p></div></div></div></div><br/>

Because agile teams are empowered at the team level to define, implement, and maintain their own processes and procedures, any unilateral action taken by a team member, even as a measure of process improvement, carries a risk of breaking dependencies. Therefore, before implementing a change, it is important to involve others on an empowered team, in order to have their full commitment, trust, and support.<br/>Unilaterally implementing a change in the team process could undermine the success of the team's efforts and negatively affect trust. Additionally, the benefits of the change are based on the opinion of only one team member. Since the change would affect the process used by the entire team, the team should be consulted first to ensure everybody is on the same page.<br/>The scenario describes an agile project. Unless stated otherwise in the scenario, change control boards are typically not used on agile projects.<br/>A functional manager (assuming the team member has one) may be in a position to offer advice, but is not necessarily empowered to make decisions or give permissions to the team members who have been assigned to an agile project.<br/></p></div></div></div></div><br/>

This model includes five stages of development that teams may go through including forming, storming, norming, performing, and adjourning. The question suggests that the project team had reached the performing stage of team development. Teams that reach the performing stage function as a well-organized unit, and the team members are interdependent and work through issues smoothly and effectively. This makes the life of project managers relatively easy and requires from them to mostly serve as a gateway between the project team and the stakeholders and delegate decision making to the team members.<br/>This answer choice describes the role of the project manager when the team is in the forming stage of their development. During the forming stage, the project team members meet and learn about the project and their formal roles and responsibilities. The project manager should provide clear direction on the project objectives and the behavior expected from the team members.<br/>This answer choice represents the role of the project manager when the team is in the storming stage of team development. During this phase, the team begins to address the project work, technical decision, and the project management approach. If the team members are not collaborative or open to differing ideas and perspectives, the environment can become counterproductive. The team needs help from the project manager to get through their struggle, listen to each other, and understand their differences.<br/>This answer choice describes the role of the project manager when the team is in the norming stage of their development. During the norming stage, the team members begin to work together and adjust their work habits and behaviors to support the team. The team members begin to trust each other. In this phase, the best course of action for the project manager is to ensure the team resolves conflicts quickly and continues to work collaboratively.

This potential threat will likely require the project team to carry out additional tasks to comply with the regulations. Compliance activities typically do not add value and are often considered overhead for a project. Agile best practices strive to minimize overhead so resources can be focused on producing value. This view is summarized in one of the Agile Manifesto principles that states, ""Simplicity - the art of maximizing the amount of work not done - is essential."" Even though overhead does not directly deliver value, some overhead, like compliance with regulations, is just mandatory. In order to understand the appropriate amount of time and money to invest in compliance activities, the project manager should analyze the consequences of non-compliance. If the consequences of non-compliance are minimal, then fewer resources can be allocated for compliance and vice-versa.<br/>The project retrospective is held at the end of the project. Waiting until the end of the project to analyze the newly identified threat would be too late as and not allow the results of the analysis to be incorporated in the development of the project's deliverables.<br/>Agile practitioners often view compliance as unnecessary overhead that does not deliver value to the customer. Therefore, the project manager may consider 'minimizing' resources (time, money, team members) allocated for compliance. However, to understand the appropriate amount of resources to invest in compliance activities, the project manager should first analyze the consequences of non-compliance.<br/>If the circumstances described in this scenario were applied to a predictive project management framework, then submitting a change request to update the risk management plan would be a plausible answer choice. However, the scenario describes an agile project. Change requests are not typically used on agile projects.<br/></p></div></div></div></div><br/>

</div></div> </div></div></div><div class='answer'><a class='ans' onclick='showHide(143)'>Ans</a><p style='display:none;' id='ans_143'>2--Projects are initiated by an entity external to the project, such as a sponsor, program or project management office (PMO), or a portfolio governing body chairperson or authorized representative. The project initiator or sponsor should be at a level that is appropriate to procure funding and commit resources to the project. Therefore, a project sponsor is external to the project, is of high power and high interest, and has an upward direction of influence. Of the available choices, only Todd Young possesses the characteristics of a project sponsor.

Note, being external to the project does not necessarily mean being external to the organization. The terms 'internal' vs. 'external' are relative to something. The column ""Internal / External to the Project"" in the table specifies what is being referred to by 'internal' and 'external'. For example, the sponsor is external to the project in that they are not a member of the immediate project team, but they are a stakeholder to the project and internal to the organization.

Based on page 550 of the reference provided, one may argue that a sponsor is a project-internal stakeholder. Unfortunately, the PMBOK® Guide does not do a great job clarifying that the examples in the ""Internal stakeholders"" and ""External stakeholders"" lists refer to stakeholders as they relate to the performing organization, not project. For example, in that list on page 550, the sponsor, resource manager, PMO, team members, etc., could be either external or internal to the project, but they are internal to the performing organization. However, customers, end-users, suppliers, etc., are external to both project and performing organization. Therefore, we strongly believe that a sponsor is an individual who is external to the project, possesses high power and high interest, and has an upward direction of influence.

Note, Figure 2-1 Project Boundaries on page 562 places the sponsor outside the project boundaries, thus supporting the idea that a sponsor is an entity external to the project.<br/>Projects are initiated by an entity external to the project such as a sponsor or project management office (PMO). John Snow is identified as internal to the project; therefore, he cannot be the project sponsor.<br/>The project sponsor is most likely to be external, high power and high interest, with an upward direction of influence. Projects are initiated by an entity or person external to the project like a sponsor or PMO. A sponsor, by definition, has high power over the project and is most likely to be of high interest. The role of the sponsor has an upward direction of influence. Of the available options, only Todd Young has all of the characteristics of a project sponsor.<br/>Marie Smith is classified as low power on the project. The initiator of a project by definition is high power as they are the one that is authorizing the project and the expenditure of resources. Additionally, a project sponsor has an upward direction of influence rather than outward. Therefore, this answer choice can be eliminated.<br/></p></div></div></div></div><br/>

High performing agile teams are cross-functional as they are comprised of T-shaped people (also known as generalizing specialists). Generalizing specialists can perform a wider range of project tasks compared to I-shaped people (specialists). An agile team of generalizing specialists will have greater flexibility, which will help avoid bottlenecks and increase throughput. Transforming the development team from I-shaped to T-shaped should improve velocity. The incorrect answer choices represent actions that would provide little to no value or would be counterproductive.<br/>One of the goals in Kanban is to maximize the value of a product delivered to the customer while minimizing work in progress (WIP). One of the principles of the Agile Manifesto states, ""Working software is the primary measure of progress."" Thus, WIP represents no value to the customer and should be minimized, not maximized.<br/>T-shaped people may have a specialized skillset but are also able to perform a wide range of tasks beyond their specialty. I-shaped people have specialized skillset but are limited to their specialty. T-shaped people offer the project team more flexibility and greater redundancy.

This model is typically referred to by project management practitioners as part of the Develop Team process. The model includes five stages: forming, storming, norming, performing, and adjourning. While it is safe to say that most teams go through all five stages, some may get stuck in a particular stage or even regress (go back) to an earlier stage. On the other hand, projects with team members who worked together in the past might skip a stage. Each stage is distinguished by different dynamics among the team members resulting in various levels of team effectiveness. Team effectiveness is at its lowest level during the storming stage as the environment is characterized by a high degree of conflict and a lack of collaboration among the team members. As the team members begin to work together and trust each other, in other words, the relationships between the team members normalize (thus the name of the next stage, norming), the degree of team effectiveness increases. Teams that successfully go through the norming stage would eventually reach the performing stage, which is the highest level of team development. In the performing stage, the team function as a well-organized unit, and the team effectiveness is at its highest.<br/>Area A represents the forming phase of the team development model. In this phase, the team members meet and learn about the project and their formal roles and responsibilities. Team members tend to be independent and not as open. The scenario describes disagreements and conflicts, making this choice an incorrect answer.<br/>Area B represents the storming phase of team development. During this phase, the team begins to address the project work, technical decisions, and the project management approach. If team members are not collaborative, the environment can become counterproductive, resulting in low team effectiveness. The scenario closely matches this description, making storming the best answer to the question asked.<br/>Area C represents the norming stage of the team development model. In this phase, team members begin to work together and adjust their work habits and behavior to support the team. The team members learn to trust each other. The scenario describes disagreements and conflicts, making norming an incorrect answer.<br/></p></div></div></div></div><br/>

Brainstorming is a data gathering technique which may be useful in the development of the project charter. Brainstorming is a specialized meeting led by a facilitator which can be used to gather data and solutions or ideas from stakeholders, subject matter experts, and team members when developing the project charter. Note, the question is asking for the activity which is 'least' likely to be conducted during the development of the project charter. The communications management plan is not created until later in the project during the Plan Communications Management process. Therefore, the project manager would not be able to follow the communications management plan in determining the meeting attendees, making this the 'least' likely activity to be conducted in this scenario.<br/>A stakeholder is an individual, group, or organization that may affect, be affected by, or perceive itself to be affected by a decision, activity, or outcome of a project.

In these cases, a governing agreement such as a master services agreement (MSA) may be used for the overall engagement, with the adaptive work being placed in an appendix or supplement. This hybrid strategy allows changes to occur on the adaptive scope without impacting the overall contract. The incorrect answer choices represent actions that will not permit the selected vendor from using the best project management approach for each aspect of the project. Since both vendors are capable of delivering both the hardware and the software, and since there is not enough information in the question to determine which one of them is better in delivering projects using waterfall or agile project management approach, among the available choices, utilizing a master services agreement (MSA) with either of the vendors provides the best answer to the question asked.

<br/>This approach represents a course of action which resolves the issue of which project management methodology to use. However, since both vendors are equally capable of producing both the hardware and the software, then it is better to make appropriate arrangements to allow one vendor to deliver both as it may save project resources in managing one vendor instead of two.<br/>As stated by the scenario, it has been concluded that an agile framework is best for developing the software component of the project, but not the hardware. Limiting the vendor to use one approach over another would diminish from the benefits of using the best project management approach for each aspect of the project.<br/>According to the question text, a traditional waterfall project management approach is best to develop the hardware for the project in this case, but not the software component.

The scrum master should work with the team to ensure that the obstacles are cleared as efficiently and effectively as possible so the development can get back to work on the project's deliverables. However, before the scrum master can work on removing the blockers, the impediments should first be analyzed and prioritized. For example, it is possible that one impediment is currently blocking the entire team, and others might only be affecting individual team members. Thus, it will be important to address the most severe and time-critical impediments first. Therefore, of the available options, the scrum master should first analyze and prioritize the blockers.

Note, the scenario describes a project in which the project schedule is managed using the traditional/predictive project management approach (""the schedule baseline is in jeopardy"") while the work is carried out using the Scrum framework, which is one of the agile methods (""a scrum master is conducting a daily standup""). This means the project as a whole is managed in a hybrid way. While this information does not change the correct answer, it is important to understand that projects can be managed using various approaches, including predictive (sometimes called traditional or waterfall), agile, or hybrid which is a combination of both.<br/>While it is essential to remove the blockers as quickly as possible, the scenario indicates that a daily standup meeting is underway. The daily standup is a meeting in which impediments are identified. However, this meeting is not intended to find solutions for the impediments.<br/>The various impediments described in the scenario should first be analyzed and prioritized in order to determine the most efficient and effective path for clearing them.<br/>Reassigning the team to another project is an overreaction. If the blockers are removed quickly, the team can continue working on the existing project. The impediments should first be analyzed before a decision to move the team to another project (if at all) is made.<br/></p></div></div></div></div><br/>

Even though the iteration plan should be determined by the development team, the agile coach, as a servant leader, should take steps to provide each team member with the opportunity to express their opinion and ensure any commitments are agreed upon by the entire team. Under these circumstances, it is appropriate for the servant leader to perform a consensus check. One common method of conducting a consensus check is the fist-of-five voting method. With this method, the leader asks the team members to vote in unison by raising their hand with the number of fingers related to their level of support or degree of confidence in a commitment (closed fist represents no support up to five fingers for full support). Any team member with less than three fingers is then allowed to express their concerns. The leader then continues the fist-of-five process until a consensus is reached.<br/>The project retrospective occurs at the end of the project. Agile teams should inspect and adapt throughout the project rather than waiting until the project is over.

This means that the project manager and team will likely use a combination of agile as well as traditional tools and techniques while planning, executing, monitoring, controlling, and closing the project. A resource breakdown structure is a project document that is created as one of the outputs of the Estimate Activity Resources process implied by the scenario. This document can be graphically displayed as a hierarchical representation of resources by category and type and can help in project resource planning by providing a structured view of project resources.

A common way to decompose staff (personnel) entries in the resource breakdown structure is to categorize them according to their level of skills or authority. With level 1 indicating a project stakeholder in a leading role, such as the product owner, who is likely to be mapped to the ""Personnel (level 1)"" category. A team member best fits the ""Personnel (level 2)"" category, and so on.

Additional time may be needed to set clear expectations, facilitate communications, develop protocols for resolving conflict, include people in decision making, understand cultural differences, and share credit for success. When the project team is located in the same physical space, communication is much easier and more effective. Face-to-face communication is richer and is the most effective form of communication. Tone and non-verbal communication may be lost in a virtual environment. Additionally, virtual teams lack the intangible benefits of colocated teams who are able to bond more easily and become more cohesive. Therefore, communication planning will require special consideration while working with a virtual team.<br/>One of the advantages of the team members working from their home offices as a virtual team is the expense savings associated with offices and physical equipment needed for employees if they were working in the company’s offices.

Predictive, iterative, agile, or hybrid are examples of the development approach. The main differences between the various development approaches lie in the way requirements are defined and managed, project deliverables are produced, change is handled, risk and cost are controlled, and stakeholders are involved. The different development approaches can be visually displayed on what is called, the continuum of project life cycles. A predictive development approach is at one extreme of the continuum, while the agile approach is at the other end, with hybrid models being anywhere in between. The scenario describes a project in which requirements are elaborated at several intervals during delivery; the delivery is divided into subsets of the overall product; change is incorporated at periodic intervals; risk and cost are controlled by progressively elaborating the plans with new information; and, key stakeholders are regularly involved. These practices combine elements of both predictive and agile life cycles, making the whole development approach hybrid.

Note, the development approach is sometimes called the development life cycle.<br/>On agile projects, requirements are elaborated frequently during delivery; delivery occurs frequently with customer-valued subsets of the overall product; change is incorporated in real-time during delivery; risk and cost are controlled as requirements and constraints emerge; and, key stakeholders are continuously involved.<br/>On predictive projects, requirements are defined up-front before development begins; a single final product is delivered at the end of the project; change is constrained as much as possible; risk and cost are controlled by detailed planning; and, key stakeholders are involved at specific milestones.<br/>On hybrid projects, requirements are elaborated at several intervals; delivery is divided into subsets of the overall product; change is incorporated at periodic intervals; risk and cost are controlled by progressively elaborating the plans with new information; and, key stakeholders are regularly involved.

Under these circumstances and with the information provided in the scenario, the traditional formulas to calculate the earned value parameters would not work. The way to calculate the ETC, in this case, is to multiply the remaining number of story points by the average cost per story point. The team has completed 100 story points (4 sprints with 25 story points each), which is 1/3 of the total amount of story points for the project. If 100 story points represent 1/3 of the total scope, then the total scope is 300 story points, leaving 200 story points remaining to be completed. Using the remaining number of story points on the project, 200, you need to multiply it by the average cost per story point, $575, to determine the expected cost for completing the remainder of the project. Following are the detailed calculations in this situation:


Total Story Points Completed = 100
Total Story Points Remaining = 200
Average Cost Per Story Point = $575
Remaining Cost for Project Completion = 200 * $575 = $115,000

Please note, the question is asking about the cost to complete the 'remaining' story points on the project, not the 'total' of the story points on the project.<br/>$57,500 represents the cost of the story points earned rather than the expected remaining cost.<br/>The expected cost remaining for the project is $115,000, which is the product of the story points remaining, 200, and the cost per story point, 575.<br/>$14,375 is the product of the average velocity (25 points) and the average cost per story point ($575), which represents the average cost per sprint rather than the estimated cost to complete the project.<br/></p></div></div></div></div><br/>

The current EV is the sum of the earned values for every activity that either has been completed or is in progress. As only the first two activities have been completed, the project's current earned value is $10,000. However, according to the plan, the third activity should also have been 50% complete. Note, since the scenario mentions that the method used to determine the earned value is based on percent complete, the earned value of a partially completed work package is calculated by multiplying the planned value of the work package by its the percent complete. Therefore, the total current planned value is ($5000 * 100%) + ($5000 * 100%) + ($20,000 * 50%) = $20,000. Therefore, the SPI = EV / PV = $10,000 / $20,000 = 0.5. Since the SPI of 0.5 is less than 1.0, the project is currently behind schedule. Note that the information regarding the fast-tracking of activities later in the project is not relevant in calculating the current SPI. Therefore, an SPI of 0.5 with the project currently behind schedule is the best answer to the question asked.<br/>The schedule performance index (SPI) is the earned value (EV) divided by planned value (PV). SPI = $10,000 / $20,000 = 0.5. With the SPI below 1.0, the project is currently behind schedule.<br/>This answer choice represents a miscalculation. The schedule performance index (SPI) is the earned value (EV) divided by planned value (PV). If the EV and PV are transposed in the formula, the result is 2.0<br/>A schedule performance index of 1.0 would indicate that the project is on schedule. However, even though the project manager is confident fast-tracking can bring the schedule back into alignment with the plan, this action will not occur until later in the project.

This approach, especially with software development products, often results in more defects in comparison to the iterative and incremental approach. What customer demands for the second phase can be achieved by incorporating agile practices, making the second phase hybrid. For many project teams who need to introduce more agility, setting up regular timeboxes and frequent retrospectives help organize the team's work in close collaboration with the customer. In addition to a more iterative approach, an incremental delivery using a backlog is another good first step towards agility in a project. According to the scenario, the team has problems with poor quality – test-driven development practices can address that.<br/>By setting up a cadence in the form of regular timeboxes, a team can schedule interaction with the relevant stakeholders (including the customer) regularly and iteratively. Many teams find a cadence helpful in demonstrating the working product increments to the customer, get feedback, and improve.<br/>Conducting regular and frequent retrospectives is one of the Agile Manifesto principles, ""At regular intervals, the team reflects on how to become more effective, then tunes and adjusts its behavior accordingly."" This concept is also known as ""continuous improvement"". Applying this principle would help the team to learn, improve, and adapt, likely resulting in improved customer satisfaction.<br/>The lean manufacturing concept of ""optimizing the whole"" with a systemic view suggests that optimization is much more effective when it’s done at the project level instead of the individual team member's level. Therefore, this answer choice is unlikely to contribute to the team's effort in addressing the customer's request.<br/></p></div></div></div></div><br/>

Based on our own experience as well as feedback from our customers, answer choices in the actual exam can be very similar to one another. Sometimes, a tiny nuance in the wording determines which choice is the correct answer.

To answer agile questions correctly, it is important to get into the agile mindset. This particular question deals with the concept of duties and principles of agile servant leadership. One of the principles that servant leaders follow is creating an environment of functional accountability. In the reference provided, the author states that servant leaders ""give the team ample space to come up with the best ideas and build the best product."" In order for the team to become self-organized and accountable for their own results, the author suggests that ""If you [the agile coach] stay at the process level and stay away from the details of the team’s every decision and plan, you can achieve detachment. Your being detached invites them to attach and to own their results. This helps them achieve goals asked (and sometimes demanded) of them."" Owning the results is one of the principles servant leaders should engrain in their teams. In this way, teams can learn to be accountable for outcomes.

The question is asking what the agile coach should do 'first'. There is not enough information in the scenario to determine that, if the issue is not resolved, the team will miss the iteration goal, or the project will fail. According to the scenario, the issue is minor. It is not an extreme situation where the agile coach would need to step in and help the team resolve the issue or even resolve the issue by herself. Even though the agile coach has the needed expertise, resolving the issue is not the agile coach's responsibility. Furthermore, servant leaders should let the team make technical decisions and own the outcomes, whether the outcome leads to success or failure. Servant leaders should remove themselves from the outcome. The author stresses that ""If you diagnose the problem and implement a solution, you run the risk of being way off base. Worse, you have subtly undermined the team's ability to solve its own problems.""<br/>Applying agile servant leadership principles to this situation, the 'first' thing the agile coach should do is letting the team members try to resolve the issue on their own so that the team can own the decision and be accountable for the outcome.<br/>According to the scenario, the issue is minor. Therefore, letting the team resolve the issue would be a better approach. If the team doesn’t succeed, the coach should help. However, the coach should not do the technical work for the team. Rather, the coach may help in providing expertise or getting necessary development tools, etc.<br/>Even though the agile coach has the expertise to resolve the issue, resolving the issue for the team would not be the first step for the agile coach to take, nor is this the responsibility of an agile coach regardless of what previous experience she may have.<br/></p></div></div></div></div><br/>

The question states, ""A project manager is executing the quality management plan of a project..."" This implies that the Manage Quality process is being performed. Data representation techniques including the cause-and-effect diagram can be useful during this process. Cause-and-effect diagrams are also known as fishbone diagrams, why-why diagrams, or Ishikawa diagrams. This type of diagram breaks down the causes of the problem statement identified into discrete branches, helping to identify the main or root cause of the problem. Of the available choices, the cause-and-effect or Ishikawa diagram is the most useful in determining the main cause of a quality issue, making the development of an Ishikawa diagram the best answer to the question asked.<br/>Directing the project team to improve the quality of their work is not very helpful without first knowing the main cause of the problem. For example, it is possible that the issue lies with the material and/or equipment rather than the quality of the project team's work. Therefore, this choice is an incorrect response.<br/>The project sponsor may very well need to be informed of the quality issues, but it is the project manager's responsibility to determine the cause and implement the necessary action. Therefore, this answer choice can be eliminated.<br/> Affinity diagrams can organize potential causes of defects into groups showing areas that should be focused on the most. However, the question indicates that the causes of the poor quality are not known at this point. Therefore, the project manager should first seek to understand the main cause(s) of the quality issues, making the creation of an affinity diagram an incorrect answer.<br/></p></div></div></div></div><br/>

Sometimes these situations are complex, requiring a lot of debate and discussion; other times these are very simple decisions. These minor conflicts are commonplace in almost every project. A project environment that supports the decision making and trust among team members, so they can resolve issues and find beneficial solutions are hallmarks of high-performing teams. A project manager must assist in creating and developing such an environment and the team. That sometimes means backing away from situations where the project manager is not a value-add and allowing the project team to problem solve and decide. While this option sounds counter-intuitive, under the circumstances described in the scenario, withdrawing from the conflict and not making the decision is the best course of action for the project manager.<br/>Although experience or tenure at a company may provide one with more knowledge and leverage a certain advantage, requiring the team members to go with the decision of the most senior person is most likely not the best way to resolve a technical issue.

Although the question does not indicate what, if any, training was provided, of the available options, only providing training for the product owner might have been beneficial in helping the product owner better prioritize the product backlog so that the highest value tools would have been developed first.<br/>The product owner is responsible for prioritizing the product backlog according to business value. Training for the product owner might have been beneficial in helping the product owner understand how to prioritize the product backlog properly.<br/>Pair programming is an XP core practice where two developers write code as a pair. Code refactoring is the process of improving the design of existing code. Both activities refer to the technical aspects of software development while, according to the scenario, the issue is with how the tools were prioritized rather than how they were coded.<br/>Agile promotes the concept of failing fast/early, rather than avoiding it. Therefore, agile leaders encourage the development of the highest-risk features first. The idea is that if a project is doomed to fail, it is better to learn that early in the project lifecycle so that the expenditure of time and resources will be minimized. This answer choice contradicts the concept of fast failure.<br/></p></div></div></div></div><br/>

An effective and skilled scrum master can accomplish this without 'managing' the team. The scrum master should help by using facilitation and coaching. This facilitation can involve getting the entire team together to come to a consensus on the most appropriate iteration length or helping to create a safe environment for the team members to have the discussion. For example, the scrum master could suggest the team members discuss the pros and cons of each suggested iteration length to help the team reach a consensus.<br/>According to the scenario, the argument between the team members is intense, with little chance to reach a consensus, warranting the involvement of the scrum master. Avoiding being involved in the process would unlikely help in achieving a positive outcome.<br/>When an argument reaches an impasse, and a positive outcome is unlikely, the scrum master should facilitate the discussion between the involved parties so they can reach an agreement. Providing the pros and cons of each one of the suggested iteration lengths would likely soften the tension and bring the discussion down to a reasonable level.<br/>It is quite evident that threatening the team members with disciplinary actions if they are unable to come to an agreement is not the best course of action for any manager/leader, especially on agile projects.

When some aspects of the procurement are well-defined up-front but others are unknown, the parties to the contract may use a multi-tiered contract structure. This contracting technique allows for capturing various aspects of the procurement in different documents. For example, mostly fixed items, such as warranties and arbitration, can be locked in a master services agreement (MSA), while more dynamic items, such as scope, schedule, and budget, can be formalized in a lightweight statement of work. While the scenario does not provide specific details as to what items are fixed and what are variable, of the choices provided, multi-tiered structure best addresses the question asked. This structure reflects a hybrid project management approach in which part of the procurement is managed using predictive methods, while the other part is addressed with agile contracting techniques.<br/>A multi-tiered structure is an agile or hybrid contracting technique that best works for procurements in which some aspects are well-defined up-front while others are unknown. This technique uses a master services agreement (MSA) to document fixed items and a lightweight statement of work to capture those that are yet to be discovered.<br/>Cost plus award fee is an example of a cost-reimbursable contract in which the seller is reimbursed based on specific criteria. This choice is an incorrect answer for two reasons: first, cost plus award fee is a contract, not a contracting technique, as asked by the question. Second, it does not address the essence of the question, which focuses on how to contractually handle a procurement that has requirements of a various degree of clarity.<br/>A procurement audit is one of the tools and techniques of the Control Procurements process. The audit is a structured review of the procurement process rather than a contracting technique used to address the uncertainty of requirements during the Plan Procurement Management process, as described by the scenario.<br/></p></div></div></div></div><br/>

While the use of the instant messaging application on the mobile phones may lead you to think the question is talking about communication technology, communication models, or communication methods, the word 'mandatory' should trigger the thought of enterprise environmental factors. Any condition, not under the immediate control of the team that influences, constraints, or directs the project, is an enterprise environmental factor (EEF). Established communication channels, tools, and systems are an example of the EEF. Since the instant messaging application is defined as 'mandatory' by your organization, meaning it is outside the project team's control, the requirement to install the application qualifies as an EEF, in particular as an established communication tool. Therefore, of the choices provided, enterprise environmental factors are the best answer to the question asked.

<br/>Pull communication is a type of communication method that requires recipients to access the content at their discretion. This method is typically used for large audiences or complex data sets. The requirement to install the application described in the scenario does not represent a pull communication method.<br/>Push communication is a type of communication method where information is distributed to specific recipients. This method ensures the information is sent but does not guarantee the information was received or understood by the recipient. The requirement to install the application and a communication method are not the same.<br/>The scenario implies you are carrying out the Plan Communications Management process. Enterprise environmental factors are input to that process. Enterprise environmental factors are conditions, not under the immediate control of the team, that influence, constrain, or direct the project. The scenario describes an instant messaging application that is mandated by your organization to be used for communication. 'Mandatory' means the application is not under the immediate control of the team, making the requirement to install the application an enterprise environmental factor.<br/></p></div></div></div></div><br/>

This hybrid project management practice, traditional scope control approach using agile methods, can be documented in the lessons learned register, which is a project document used to record knowledge gained during a project so that it can be used in the current project. At the end of the project or phase, the information in the lessons learned register is transferred into the lessons learned repository as an organizational process asset, where it can be used to improve the performance of future projects. Therefore, of the available choices, capturing the best practice in the lessons learned register is the best way to prevent gold plating for the remainder of the current project and on future projects.<br/>A project retrospective is a review scheduled at the end of a project to record lessons learned in the lessons learned register. While bringing up any best practices during a project retrospective is a good idea, there is no reason to wait until the end of the project to capture the best practice in the lessons learned register. Best practices should be captured in the lessons learned register at the time the knowledge is gained to ensure performance can be improved for the remainder of the project and then transferred to the lessons learned repository for use on future projects.

A project sponsor approves and signs off the charter and acts as a project champion who supports the project, the project manager, and is concerned with the project's success. Therefore, the difficulty the project manager is encountering with decision making and acquiring computer hardware may have been eliminated if there had been a charter. The project charter also states the purpose, primary objectives, and vision for the project and would have provided the project team, as well as the stakeholders, with the same understanding of such.

<br/>The Define Scope process results in the project scope statement which lists major project deliverables. Major project deliverables are derived from the key deliverables. However, the key deliverables are identified earlier in the project life cycle, during project initiation, and are listed in the project charter which is an input to the Define Scope process.<br/>Deliverables are produced during the Executing Process Group. Deliverables must be identified before they can be produced. Therefore, this answer choice can be eliminated.<br/>The key deliverables are identified during the Develop Project Charter process and included as an element in the project charter.

The product owner serves as the voice of the customer by representing the relevant stakeholders and providing direction to the project team. Since the product owner is responsible for working with the stakeholders to determine product requirements, it would make the most sense to have the product owner analyze and categorize the stakeholders' influence. A power and influence grid can assist the product owner in a grouping of stakeholders according to their level of authority (power) and ability to influence the outcomes of the project (influence).<br/>According to the scenario, the project is in planning. During planning, change requests are not required to update any of the components of the project management plan or project documents. In general, unless stated otherwise in the scenario, change requests are not required to update project documents, such as the stakeholder register.<br/>Understanding the stakeholders' level of influence and engaging with them as soon as possible in the project would allow the project manager to set and better manage their expectations. Waiting with this activity until the first sprint review would increase the risk of the stakeholders being unsatisfied and the product increment being rejected.<br/>On projects where the product is developed using Scrum, the product owner is responsible for working with the stakeholders to determine product requirements. Therefore, it would make the most sense to have the product owner analyze and categorize the stakeholders' influence.<br/></p></div></div></div></div><br/>

</div></div> </div></div></div><div class='answer'><a class='ans' onclick='showHide(179)'>Ans</a><p style='display:none;' id='ans_179'>4--The question suggests that the project manager is performing the Acquire Resources process. Pre-assignment is one of the tools and techniques that may be used in this process. When physical or team resources for a project are determined in advance, they are considered pre-assigned. This situation can occur if the project is the result of specific resources being identified as part of a competitive proposal or if the project is dependent upon the expertise of a particular person. Had the qualified agile coach employed by the company been pre-assigned, the resource may have been available for the other project and the situation described by the question may have been avoided.

<br/>An assumption log is a project document used to record all assumptions and constraints throughout the project life cycle. While documenting the potential unavailability of the agile coach in the project assumption log would have ensured that the project stakeholders are aware of the situation, this action alone would not have avoided the situation from occurring in the first place.<br/>The resource management plan reflects the contractual requirements, in this case, the use of a qualified agile coach. Changing the verbiage of the resource management plan does not change the contractual obligation and is not an ethical approach.<br/>The question states that the company only employs one individual with the required skillset to serve as the agile coach, and that resource is not available. Therefore, allowing another employee without the contractually required skillset to serve as the agile coach is not a viable option.<br/></p></div></div></div></div><br/>

Examples of prototypes are small-scale products, computer-generated 2D and 3D models, mock-ups, or simulations. Prototypes allow stakeholders to experiment with a model of the final product rather than being limited to discussing abstract representations of their requirements. Of the choices provided, prototyping best addresses the need of the project manager to ensure that before the actual robot is built, the team receives early feedback on requirements and adapts the design accordingly. Prototyping can be used on any type of project, traditional, agile, or hybrid.<br/>Prototyping supports the concept of progressive elaboration in iterative cycles, such as those used on agile projects described in the scenario. When enough feedback cycles have been performed, the requirements obtained from the prototype are sufficiently complete to move to the design or build phase.<br/>Although a design review meeting helps the team gain early feedback from a customer, design reviews are limited to discussing abstract representations of stakeholders' requirements. Another answer choice better addresses the question asked.<br/> A checklist is a document that contains a list of items, actions, or points to be considered. Checklists can be used for various purposes in various project management processes, on both agile and traditional projects. However, checklists are not used for getting early feedback on requirements.<br/></p></div></div></div></div><br/>
